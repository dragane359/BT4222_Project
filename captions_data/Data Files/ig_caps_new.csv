Like, really happy. 3 months in, 2022 has been a great year for me so far. Towards the end of 2021 I found myself a little directionless, feeling a little lonely, a little jaded from everything (school responsibilities, content, personal life, etc.). That all changed after that video at Chow’s crib.\n\nFrom then on, it’s been mostly an upwards trend in all aspects of my life. I’m starting to see the returns from things I started planning all the way in 2020, and put into action in 2021. A lot of it feels earned (of course, with a little luck as well), which makes me feel really chuffed.\n\nMore brands and clients are starting to come in, and more opportunities are starting to find their way towards me. I’ve deepened the relationships with the people around me, and my discord community has never been more active. I’ve also found some newfound motivation for plans in the future.\n\nI’m really grateful and I feel insanely blessed to be able to live the life that I’m living right now. Of course, I still have things that I still want to accomplish, and little worries here and there.\n\nBut I can categorically say that I haven’t been this happy before, and this excited in a long time for what’s to come in the future. And a lot of it has been due to the circle of people I’ve managed to get close to over the past months. \n\nFor the ones that have been around me the past few months, and the ones that have always been around, thank you so much ❤️', 'LF>>>>>GF 4 lyfe #datingadvice #dating #relationships', 'Playlist can be found in the link in my bio :) #whatareyoulisteningto #addasong #streetinterview #spotify', 'At least you’re not a Liverpool fan atm #manutd', 'Playlist can be found in the link in my bio :) #whatareyoulisteningto #addasong #streetinterview #spotify', 'Playlist can be found in the link in my bio :) #whatareyoulisteningto #addasong #streetinterview #spotify', 'I filmed a different type of video this time round!

It’s easy to look at something not going your way, and then let your anxiety create these crazy implausible branching narratives to believe the certainty of something not going your way.\n\nThis is because of a tendency to interpret your experience in a way that coheres to your previous experiences, feelings and beliefs. In the midst of that, it would be easy to fill the plot holes with our own narratives just to make it seem like everything makes sense and is rational. It’s something I definitely used to succumb to, and some semblance of that pattern of activity still remains.\n\n‘The more you embrace being uncertain and not knowing, the more comfortable you will feel in knowing what you don’t know.’\n\nPerhaps the best thing to do in times of uncertainty would be to simply… hang loose 🤙🏻', 'Back in the Jurassic era, I used to only wear black and white. I am proud to announce that I actually wear colours now. I like this shirt colour. \n\nAlso a reminder to everyone, if you’re thinking too much, tell yourself: “It’s not that deep.” Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. That is all.\n\n@xingweird helped me take this pic', 'Year 3 for me in NUS was an extremely tough time. I was riddled with anxiety, stemming from a failing relationship, worrying about a lack of direction of what I wanted to do (aka quarter-life crisis), felt like an imposter in the course I was in, and academic burnout (Computer Science is tough).\n\nUp till that point I never really associated the idea of mental wellbeing with myself. Me, with mental health issues? No way. Only people that were clinically diagnosed could claim they had those issues. Well, that was what I thought.\n\nIntense worry about the uncertainty of my future, feeling a sense of overwhelm and lack of control in my life due to school, constant fatigue and having trouble concentrating. A feeling of dread when it came to nighttime as I struggled to sleep; my head clogged up with thoughts and worries that plagued me throughout the day. These are all symptoms of general anxiety disorder.\n\nYou see my fellow students, you aren’t as alone as you think you are. We are all one and the same in our feelings, even if our problems differ. You may think that the problem of you stressing to get an assignment done on time is inferior to that of someone else going through a heartbreak, thus invalidating your right to be anxious.\n\nBut it’s not a competition of who has the biggest problem, where only the ones facing the most have the right to seek help for their mental health. All of us have our own problems. The right to your own feelings lies within yourself. It would be great if we could collectively start to acknowledge our own mental wellbeing, to realise that it’s okay that we might have issues, and also to know that we aren’t alone.\n\nTo help with that, NUS is organising K(NO)W Stigma 2022, an event centred around breaking the stigmas around mental wellness. Join them in a panel discussion that would help demystify the topic of mental wellness, as well as create a safe space for more in-depth dialogue surrounding mental health.\n\nFor more details, head to the @nus.hwb Instagram or Facebook page, and you can sign-up for the event through the link in my bio.\n\n#NUSAreuOK #NUSKnowStigma2022', ""Goodbye Sheares Hall, the place I could call a home for the past academic year.\n\nA lesson I've learned about home: A dream home doesn't have to be a bungalow filled with swimming pools, bowling alleys, and more amenities than one could need. You don't need a penthouse, 10,000 square feet, or a balcony that stretches out far and wide. A home is a lot more than the superficial. It's a place of safety, security, comfort, and peace. A place you go to at the end of an exhausting day and immediately feel relaxed. A place without judgment, and where you can let your mind rest and be at ease. Even if that's a small little room at the corner of NUS.\n\nI'm not someone that has a large amount of attachment to Sheares Hall as compared to some of my other graduating schoolmates. I didn't join many events or CCAs, nor have I really made a lot of friends that would honestly persist past this graduation from the hall. But I would be lying if I said that 3 of the 4 years I've stayed here haven't impacted me in a large way.\n\nThere are a few things I would miss. The peaceful and quiet nature of Pasir Panjang. Communal living with the few close friends I've taken away. The subtle chirping of birds nestled on the roof (although I won't miss the bird poop), and the gentle breeze that flows through the corridor of the rooftop floor that I stayed on. The idea of having the beautiful campus of NUS like my own backyard. The low-rise buildings nestled around the area, giving me an unobstructed view of the sky in its entirety. As you can tell, this allowed me to experience some magnificent sunsets over the past 10 months.\n\nBut what I will miss the most would be having this space I could call mine, even if it was just for a short 10 months. A place I could feel safe in, a space where I could do anything I wanted. A small little room where I could feel at peace. At home. And if this is a teaser of what owning my own place feels like, consider me motivated in wanting to achieve that sooner rather than later.\n\nGoodbye Sheares. Thank you for the lessons learned, the people I've met, the tranquility you've given me, and the motivation you've sparked inside of me."", 'petition for power pose emoji', ""Senior's farewell night in Sheares Hall, time for another WADIO\n\n2nd pic is me in AY18/19 when I first entered Sheares Hall as a dumbass phantom freshman, telling my then blockhead Alex that perhaps I wouldn't stay past the first semester.\n\n3rd-7th pics are me in AY19/20 having the time of my life going for night cycling and block trip, saying that I'm not gonna stay past the 2nd year.\n\n8th and 9th pic is me in AY21/22 still coming back for year 4...\n\nFinal pic was the best sunset I ever saw in my 3 years here, and a reminder of what I'm gonna miss the most staying in hall: (ironically) Peace and general lack of noise pollution (because I stay on the rooftop floor and the Pasir Panjang area has low traffic and low rise buildings), good air and a dope unobstructed view, and having my own safe space to come back to everyday.\n\nThings I won't miss will be the CCA culture in halls because shit is wack although the system is necessary and the comm hall food which has less variety than pasta recipes I use.\n\nCheckout the vlog on YT as I dip out of Sheares Hall for good this time round lmao wadio"", 'Some of my photos are at an exhibition in UTown!\n\nSONDER is a photography exhibition by @keviision, showcasing photos from different photographers from the Halls of NUS.

Thanks Aaron for asking me to show up at your party.', 'I’ve always said that the world is a different place for the heartbroken. It moves on a different axis, at a different speed. Time skips backwards and forwards fleetingly. The heartbroken might go through thousands of micro-emotions a day trying to figure out how to get through it without picking up the phone to hear that old familiar voice. In the land of heartbreak, moments of strength, independence, and devil-may-care rebellion are intricately woven together with grief, paralyzing vulnerability and hopelessness. Imagining your future might always take you on a detour back to the past. And this is all to say, that the next album I’ll be releasing is my version of Red.\n \nMusically and lyrically, Red resembled a heartbroken person. It was all over the place, a fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end. Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild, and tortured by memories past. Like trying on pieces of a new life, I went into the studio and experimented with different sounds and collaborators. And I’m not sure if it was pouring my thoughts into this album, hearing thousands of your voices sing the lyrics back to me in passionate solidarity, or if it was simply time, but something was healed along the way.\n\nSometimes you need to talk it over (over and over and over) for it to ever really be... over. Like your friend who calls you in the middle of the night going on and on about their ex, I just couldn’t stop writing. This will be the first time you hear all 30 songs that were meant to go on Red.

You can contribute by writing content and threads that add value to ARC, being active on our socials and Discord, being an advocate for ARC’s community IRL and online.\n\nWhile minting Pyxis early will be one of the considerations, the 3 points above will play a bigger role in improving your odds (demonstrating value, referring like-minded individuals and contributing).\n\nIt’s time for us to represent ourselves and uplift the entire Asia NFT space.

Dylan had already achieved stratospheric acclaim from his treasure-producing workmanship and poetic abilities. He had already jacked up the bar of songwriting to an untouchable level. He also became a reluctant prophet, which can be quite an occupational hazard‚Ä¶Yet he remained himself while dodging all manner of con artists, bloodsuckers, angles, arrows, ignorance, injustices, and scrutinization of his life. His intentions remained pure. So he sat down and wrote the gold standard of protest songs, the seminal and most significant, mind boggling and staggeringly poetic, prophetic protest song the world will ever know: ‚ÄúThe Times They Are A-Changin‚Äô‚Äù. Dylan‚Äôs song applies to Covid-19, it also, very strongly applies to the life altering image of George Floyd, forever seared to our brains‚Ä¶ For me, it applies to the moment we are in, it applies to the moment they were in in 1963, it applies to everything before and everything since and everything that will be. \nI chose to perform this song live, for my friend @drbarbarasturm Covid benefit several weeks ago‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt really know how to play it, but I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot, as it seemed to apply so well. And it applies now, more than ever. It was performed a couple of weeks before our collective paralysis was rendered complete by the images of our fellow human George Floyd being cruelly and brutally tortured to death on live TV.\n\nLet us take a moment to remember the sacrificial hero George Floyd and look with hope towards the changes that his tragic death will cause. And let‚Äôs salute the reluctant prophet Bob Dylan and the dream of change he inspired then, now, and onwards‚Ä¶ His impact is that of Shakespeare, Marlowe, Hunter Thompson, Marlon Brando, Woody Guthrie, William Blake, Picasso, Bach and Mozart. \nDylan‚Äôs song is to be kept near you, AT ALL TIMES!!! All love and respect,\nJD', 'As the majority of American people, our global community and our extended family of humans helplessly watched a man die on television‚Ä¶ I too, was exposed to the atrocity of blatant barbarism, \xa0ruthless cruelty and unmitigated lack of humanity. \xa0A handcuffed man, pleading for his life lay prone with the full weight of a man sworn to defend the peace on his neck. The victim of this heinous act of cowardice, George Floyd, told the officers that he could not breathe. As he called for his dead mother, how could our collective hearts not break as his face was ground and mashed firmly into the pavement by those sworn to protect him, and all of us? Justice, I desperately hope, will address the horror of Officer Chauvin‚Äôs nonchalance and indifference to his participation in the agony, suffering and ultimately the murder of our fellow traveler George Floyd in a grotesque illustration of the abuse of power!!!\nThere is no way to make sense of what is senseless. There is no way to restore a life that has been taken. Just as there is no way to un-break a heart that is broken. \nWhat we can do is make a vow to ourselves that racism and the ignorance inherent in such judgmental ugliness that it gives birth to, is NO LONGER AN OPTION!!! THERE MUST BE A CHANGE!!! DEMAND IT!!!! My dear friend and brother, Killer Mike - (Run The Jewels), is a brilliant musician, artist, activist for social justice and the son of an Atlanta Policeman. He is also, one of the kindest, most caring and loving human beings that I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure and honor to know!!! I beg everyone to listen to the remarks of this true statesman.

Then suddenly the wind shifts and off we go on a new tack. And for far too long, these earlier interests or passions sadly fall by the wayside and recede into the vast recesses of some hoarder‚Äôs crawlspace in the brain cloaked in heaps of the other things that my skull had no room for‚Ä¶until recently. \nI found this painting, which I had started in 2006 ‚Ä¶ for 14 years I‚Äôd never touched the painting ‚Äì the occasional glance, at best. Yet it somehow always lingered in my mind, this piece of unfinished business. \nEven while we are forced to live in the immediate, some strange species of the interrupted passion that has been invested in an object we once focused on awaits our return from far away. I will keep you apprised of the progress! All Love,\nJD', 'and thank you for staying on this long road with me. JD', 'I‚Äôve been working on whilst being a responsible quarantinor, quarantining.

I’d say the real beginning was taking in what I saw going on around me on set, & then starting to learn how to apply it in other parts of my life. For instance: my Mum nervously would be getting ready for her job interviews, & knowing I knew how to apply makeup after so many hours of watching other people do it in the makeup chair, we made it our ritual that I would do her face before any of her important occasions. \nThen filmmaking itself started by making love letters to my friends. Whether it was styling them, or producing photoshoots for their websites or headshots for their businesses - I loved helping out. Selfishly sometimes I also did it because I just wanted them to see all the beauty I saw in them that they never seemed to get. \nThen over time I started assisting a friend running sound on set. Then, very slowly I started working behind the camera (It hurt my back so much at first 😂). Then I got involved in editing. Now here I am, sharing my first go at directing something. \nI couldn’t have done it without the friends I could be vulnerable enough with to show that I didn’t know what I was doing & to ask for help from every step of the way. To these people (you know who you are) you have literally made a mark on my life & I hope I always get to make things WITH you. Thanks for believing in me. \n@emma_webstah this is my love letter to you. As a woman I always found the idea of living alone terrifying… & when you told me you had been living in the garage above your studio to dedicate yourself to what you really wanted to do despite everyone’s “good and well intentioned advice” - was when I knew I wanted to make my first tiny film about you. I just instantly wanted to try & capture who you were & the importance of your work. That's what feels so beautiful about directing to me - you get to fall in love!\nThanks for being so cool Emma. Your work, writing & being inspires me so much. I feel so grateful to have friends like you that I just hope I can keep up with courage-wise. Thanks for being as excited as I was about cookie dough for lunch on the shoot day. And you rock that jumpsuit.

I kept most of this by myself, but just wanted to express my gratitude to everyone at KPOP for making me able to believe.\n\n💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜\n@kpopbroadway\n@circleinthesquaretheatre \n\n#Kpop #kpopbroadway \n#kpopboadwayshow #broadwayshows \n#newyorkbroadwayshow', '이거 꼭 드셔보세요 뉴저지 맛집.. \n바베큐매니아 분들 꼭 가보세요🔥❤️\n\n감튀.. 아 너무 맛있쪄..🤩🤩\n\n#뉴저지맛집 #미국맛집 #바베큐맛집', '진짜 맛집!! 이곳은 고기샌드위치가 유명하다고 들었으나 저는 평일에 가서 못먹었습니당 ㅠㅠ 그러나 시그니처샐러드와 커피.. 정말 엄청나게 맛있어요!! 개인적으로 다이어트에 물려서 샐러드 잘 안먹는데, 하나를 보면 열을 안다규.. 다른 메뉴도 궁금해서 사먹으러 또 갈꺼에요!!☺️\n\n이번주 주말에 샌드위치 먹으러 가려구요!✨🥪\n@rh241_farm \n#뉴저지맛집 🔥', '여름 다 지나간다 움직이자!', '케이팝 브로드웨이의 그녀들💕\n브로드웨이야 곧 우리가 간다💫\n\n#kpop #kpopbroadway #broadwaymusical \n#broadwayshow #newyorkbroadwayshow', 'KPOP Broadway Coming Soon💕\n\nWith. \n@therealabraham \n@linarose.lee\n\n#newyorkbroadway #broadwayshow #kpop #luna']",0,,,

This was a huge blow to my family. My parents questioned: Why HH of all people? Why us? This is the case for most families whose kids are diagnosed with autism. \n\nGiven that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) was not well known 21 years ago as it is today, we worried about my brother’s development and ability to integrate into society. A society that wasn’t forgiving, or accepting to those who did not seem “normal” ( for a lack of a better word ). Everyday, we worried about how HH was going to go to school; make friends; get a job; talk to people; be self sufficient: and the list goes on. The worries were endless. How could we cope with having a family member with ASD, when we ourselves didn’t even know what ASD was? So, what is ASD?\n\nASD is a developmental disability that affects 1 in 150 children in 🇸🇬, and it is generally seen as a different way of thinking. People with Autism often have problems with emotional, social and communication skills- which is why many people think of them as “weird”, “loner”, “eccentric”. \n\nBut people with autism should not be defined solely by how they communicate, feel, or act. They just operate a little differently, and different is not necessarily bad. Different can be good. But not everyone thinks that way! And that begets the question: how can I be more accepting of someone who has autism? \n\nI don’t think there is a right answer to this. You can find a way to do so that suits you! It will definitely not be easy, but please remember to be respectful, and get over prejudice & bias that you may have. It is not everyday you may meet someone with autism, but when you do, be kind. \n\nIt has taken me & my family years, to learn how to cope and function with HH. The journey was difficult, and I do not think it will be easy for years to come. But I am grateful for everything HH has taught us- to be kind, patient, and loving.\n\n#worldautismawarenessday', 'my obsession with the sky! will! never! end!', 'bringing back an oldie but (a) goodie....\n\nshould I cut my hair?', 'me & plant 🪴', 'all smiles for 2021🧡', 'hi!! it me', 'free drinks always welcomed? ‘twas a fun gals night out 🤍', '🖤🤍\n/\nArt direction: Brian \nStyling: Vanessa @vnessalsy / Cassilda @cassildaalphonsine \nPhotography: Phoebe @phhoebeliew \nHair and Make up: Analisa @anegeilis \nLighting: Noah @noahchiam', '3am sometimes, light is found in the darkest of times', 'doge!!', 'love for batik & brunch knows no bounds~ 🔆', 'a day late, and I am still thinking hard about yesterday’s dinner😍and yes also, happy 2nd anniversary ❤️', 'mid week blues made better with brunch and lotsa laughter!! and hopefully some mimosa next time💙', 'for the third member aka alex aka flora aka buttercup!!', '🍢', 'play, boy.', 'I can’t stop laughing🤡', None, 'not my glass of🍷', 'I have an unhealthy obsession with clouds', 'easy sundays with you ~', '5/5 power walkers / vegan wannabes\n#efficiency', 'these 2 months at home is giving me newfound confidence! confidence I longed to have? not sure why, but maybe it is the lack of social interaction🤘🏻', 'I like my new white wall🤘🏻', 'back at it with my photo trio', 'missing my last month tgt with these gals | we shouldn’t have had to part so soon(◞‸◟)', None, 'just me, my windows, and the blue blue sky.', 'cooked my fav sesame oil chicken today!! go have fun with this recipe😩', 'hey friends! just a video I wanted to share as I’m stuck at home!! but yes, it’s a modified version, and heads up, I’m not a cook whatsoever so don’t hate❤️', 'okay but in all seriousness, tbh it rlly sucks to not be able to hangout with your friends and extended family for your 21st!!

The voice that’s constantly telling myself that I’m never going to ever achieve enough or never going to reach my goals because I’m too unfocused, I’m too loud, I moved too quickly and recklessly.\n\nBut I almost always forget that little voice in my head that’s constantly reassuring me that I’m doing amazing, I have all the tools I need to succeed and I really just need to breathe. I constantly felt locked in a box but was holding onto the exact key that would set me free. This audio captured my exact thoughts these few days where I’m practicing to be more in touch with my feminine 💅🏼energy and to really find a balance between being hard on myself for the RIGHT reasons and rewarding myself for the steps I’ve made to get there. If this audio also resonated with you - drop me a ☀️ to share that it did! 💘', ""Hi, i know I haven’t been posting much regarding mental health but today is International Women’s Day where it is a day that celebrates the progress made towards achieving gender equality and women's empowerment.\n\nI thought - what better way to commemorate this day other than sharing a story of how I almost lost my life and lost a part of me last year and that this year, I’m taking back my power by not hiding behind the guilt, trauma and pain anymore.\n\nTW: Ectopic Pregnancy, Death:\n\nEarly last year in January 2021, I rushed myself to the A&E at a hospital near my home because I thought I had appendicitis/ Rhabdomyolysis due to sharp pains in my abdomen. It turned out that I was pregnant and that it was an ectopic pregnancy, this occurs when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the main cavity of the uterus (in my case it was on my left Fallopian tube). An ectopic pregnancy is also fatal for the fetus as it cannot survive outside of the uterus.\n\nWhat this meant for me was that the pain I felt earlier in that day was all me - 5-6 weeks pregnant with a deceased fetus and with 700mls of blood flowing in my organs causing my internal bleeding from within. I was then rushed to surgery shortly after and was discharged 2 days later. \n\nI’ve lived with this pain everyday since then and I’ve went through a roller coaster of emotions, from pure denial that something this traumatic can ever happen to me, to dealing with the hospital debt after and trying to go back and forth to negotiate the instalments and lastly, to putting up a front to everyone I knew and hiding this truth for the longest time.\n\nI’ve learned along the way that my toxic trait was thinking I could hold the world’s worries on my shoulders, and run. But all I was doing was trudging in mud that sank deeper each time. I’m done hiding behind my pain now, I’m still learning to let the people I’m closest to nearer to me but it’s still a work in progress. \n\n(CONT.

I use this face wash twice daily (once in the morning and once in the night).\n\n🌿 Then, I pamper my skin with the Neem Face Pack at night before going to bed!

Past couple weeks I think I was hitting a rough patch. I think Chloe and I were both hitting a rough spot. The long distance was starting to wear on us and a poison started to fill my heart. Poison of resentment and hae started to penetrate deep into my heart and I was hating everything. I hated that Chloe’s not here, I hated that I experienced imperfect Singapore with the pandemic and I hated that my life felt incomplete all of sudden. And all that hate and blame was directed at Singapore for the rules and laws that prevented chloe and me being together on this island. I think me leaving this beautiful island is starting to show with resentment towards the country I live in and the place I work at.\nBut today my heart got convicted. I got convicted with the truth that I am loved. I am adored and I am looked after even if I don’t feel that. All of sudden I saw that how loved I am by people in Singapore. Yes, it’s sad that I am leaving this island and yes it’s stupid that it has come to this. However like the pastor Chris said today God’s grace and favour might dress differently for you than it does for other people. There is a reason God’s grace and favour is showing like this. And that God’s blessing is right in my face everyday. One of God’s blessings, my dear friend jonty, I processed that I am resenting Singapore but how foolish I was not to see how much I am loved by many people here. God specifically placed these people in my life for a reason and this circle I have in Singapore it’s not the end. It’s not permanent. I think maybe I was getting heart broken because I was secretly processing to “close” this chapter and closing meaning never see them again but that’s not true. It’s not permanent. I will see them again and I will be back again. This family is here to stay in my life and it might not be what I imagined to be but God’s grace is that much bigger, much bigger than what I can understand.

Basically a big hill out of the Navy Yards, the. A straight climb up Williamsburg Bridge. \nI’ve also been struggling with my breathing lately, so I definitely felt a small side stitch coming on again…\n\nMile 4 - 6:35min/mi\nWith the downhill of the bridge I was able to make up some time. I missed the first light off the bridge and had to take a small detour, which threw my bearings off and took me in a slightly wrong direction. \n\nMile 5 - 7:42min/mi\nI was lost in Chinatown for 2 blocks, which cost me about a minute and added 0.1mi to my route. Another runner was extremely lost and I was able to quickly navigate us back to the Manhattan Bridge, which meant another big climb for about half a mile. (If you’ve never ran in the city, your main elevation gain will come from the bridges 🌉) \n\nFinish (5.91mi) - 6:11min/mi\nComing off the bridge I was able to build a strong finish.

(Remember “easy” is still an effort. So if it feels hard it’s okay to pull it back)\n\n1️⃣ Start the run VERY conservative and slowly pick up the pace. This is called a Progressive Run, and those Easy Runs are a great way to practice! Try hitting your easy day goal pace as the overall average. \n\n2️⃣ Try to hit every split (mile or km) exactly at the planned pace. This is called Even Splits. This is usually best done on flatter terrain but it’s a great way to practice controlling your pace. \n\n3️⃣ Use your goal pace as a guideline, hide your watch and run based off effort. You might not end up exactly at the average pace you planned for, but this is a great way to practice road racing. Especially on hilly terrains. You learn to control your pace based on perceived effort!\n•\nLet me know on the comments if you’ve ever tried any of these! 💬\n•\n•\n•\n#effortbasedrunning #progressiverun #evensplits #evenpace #easyrun #easyrunning #easydayrun #run #runnersofinsta #runtalkrun #runworkouts #runcommunity #runculture #runningtights #rainyrun #runworkout #runnerlife #runnyc #nikerunning #saysky #sayskyrunning #sayskyworld #runningreels #diversewerun #practicerunning #practicepacing #pacing #cchungy', 'It’s Monday.

(Even in classes I teach now.) This is a method of retrieving information from your brain using specific triggers. I use keywords to help trigger relevant concepts for my students, so they are able to quickly identify what a question is asking for, and what concept is needed to solve it\n\n3. mindmaps! drawing mind maps helps my mind to link everything I have learnt, in a visual manner, and allows me to see the big picture, which is something that is commonly neglected, when we spend too much time fixating on individual chapters.', 'Pink fit is my fav here, which is yours? 💕', 'Some days are slower and that’s okay ✨', 'happy birthday Singapore 🇸🇬 celebrating today in my own quiet way ♥️', 'Visited this beautiful garden exhibition in the city, wearing the comfiest cardigan from @lovebonitosg', 'Let’s talk about how I nearly got hacked.

As a swimmer, it’s pretty challenging to be stuck in the middle of what the nation expects you to be as an athlete representing the nation versus the things that you can commit to, like training requirements or the time needed to do the things you need to. It’s about time we had a national dialogue, we all sat down together and discussed, what are the expectations our athletes are facing. National Service is something we all need to do and no one is shying away from that. We need to manage expectations, the reality of that. At the end of the day, I\'m gonna step up there and do my best no matter if I\'m in the shape I am or not. But as the people watching on TV, they have a lot of expectations. We as athletes we want to match those expectations. So it\'s all about how we can both grow together and how sporting achievements can coincide. And I think we\'re on the right track - we just need to sit down, ask some tough questions. It\'s going to be rough, but I think we\'re going to come out on the right side at the end of the day."" — Joseph Schooling \n\nI agree with what Joseph said and I think that National Service and sports can co-exist.

From endless travels, competitions & training camps, to nothingness. The momentum & flow that I’ve gotten used to came to a grinding halt for the first time for as long as I could remember. \n\nBeing an athlete in a pandemic laden world is a mixed bag of emotions. While we try to stick to our process and our normal, it was apparent that the circumstances surrounding us were changing in immeasurable ways.

Then the tsunami of emotions finally hit and I wondered into the abyss of questioning if everything was worth it. \n\nWe chase that high, that high when we drop 0.29 seconds in a 50m. That rush. It’s us against the clock. Not anybody or anything else.\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever trained harder in my life for something I so desperately desired. I was micro managing every aspect of my life - from recovery, training, nutrition to psychology. It came so naturally to me. \n\nBut that is just how Sports is, - certainly even how Life is at times. We give our all, control every minutia, only to see outcome that is simply not commensurate with the effort we have put in. But we get back at it again.\n\nI realised that the reward for my diligence cannot be viewed solely as a timing on a board. The bonds forged with my team mates, the memories of our deepest struggles and most importantly, the courage to give it my all, tell the world about it and accepting whatever the results were. To stand tall & proud of simply leaving everything on the deck. I am extremely grateful to have the privilege to do this.

This is my first experience with meal plan services and I think I am sold and will definitely incorporate this into my future training seasons! Helped me lean up a little too🔥\n\n- You don’t have to think about what to eat. It is all planned out, delivered to you. (Gotta admit, the hardest question of the day is always - what should I eat today? 🤣) \n\n- It is healthy AND delicious. Asian fusion, western. They’ve got it covered. Many times, healthy food usually comes hand in hand with bland and tasteless food. This is the total opposite! 🤙🏼\n\n- So convenient! 3 minutes in the microwave and it’s ready for consumption! Preparing food and buying food takes up ALOT of time. (A busy individual I am, I know many of you guys are too, this is a life saviour !!) 😍\n\nHead over to their website as they are having a 15% sale for next week’s meal plan! If you’re not in time for that, you can always use “AMANDAXSOULGRUB” for 10% off 🥰\n\nPeace out guys, it’s go time !! 🔥🔥🔥\n\n📸 : @stephjxchen \n\n#soulgrub #soulgrubsg #speedo #pridemonth #pride #LFG', 'Dedicating this post to one of my very few woke friends.

Let’s all take a minute and think about how crazy that is. And it’s not just that, it’s the crazy amount of work you put in every single day. Being first at the pool, last to leave. Doing the entire open water (not even distance) sets ON YOUR OWN. The expenses, the time and dedication - it’s just immeasurable. Nobody else deserves this more than you! 😊\n\nThank you for being an inspiration !!

Many of us make mistakes. Not all of us own up and face the consequences with courage. True to the bravery of an Olympic Champion, Joseph owned up to using cannabis in the past despite there not being any evidence against him - his urine tested negative for cannabis. \n\nHow many of us are brave enough to admit to something if there is a high chance that we can get away with it?\n\nIt’s very common for people to smoke cannabis overseas, athlete or not. It’s almost as common as beer. Elite athletes have enjoyed cannabis while enjoying success in their sports careers - Michael Phelps and Diego Maradona are prime examples that you can be at the top of the world and have a little fun as well.\n\nSmoking cannabis will not affect Jo’s career. But the outsized overreactions by our society could really affect his mental health. We hope that as Singaporeans, we can handle the situation sensibly, and support our champion as he picks himself up.\n\nFor at Takagi Ramen, we have always believed in second chances.\n\nReminder - Don’t smoke cannabis in Singapore! Drugs is not good for you! If you want to have fun, come to our Marine Parade outlet. We serve alcohol at supermarket prices 24/7 but please take everything in moderation, alochol can be very addictive too!\n\n#supportlocalatheletes #secondchances #takagiramen', 'Key points:\n1) Marijuana/Cannabis is not a banned drug out of competition.\n2) @josephschooling never tested positive. He confessed to using marijuana in Vietnam after being implicated by association with another swimmer. The details of how exactly this investigation unfolded are not being reported clearly by the mainstream media.\n3) The use of marijuana in no way provided Jo with an illegal performance enhancing advantage. I also feel this should be emphasised by the media.\n\nOn a macro level, Singapore just needs to grow up. Anyone who’s been outside this little island would know we are a laughing stock to the world because of some of these laws. Banning cannabis use in Singapore is reasonable. Banning Singaporeans from smoking cannabis overseas, is overreaching, extraterritorial, and I believe unnecessary.\n\nStanding with Jo. Stay strong. 💪🏼🇸🇬', 'Received a number of questions on how to run a 6min 50sec 2.4km. Best advice I can give is: train hard, and run even splits for each 400m lap:\n68.9sec\n68.5\n68.2\n68.3\n69.7\n66.8\n\nPersonally I felt I executed almost perfectly but lost a bit of focus on 5th lap which cost me one second and that sub 6:50. Always something to learn for the next race!\n\nWatch the race video at: https://youtu.be/7SWZQNBeiG4', 'Congrats! Welcome to the world, Haytham! 🐣', 'No better time to wear this @underarmour shirt! #LoveAllAthletes #Repeal377A', '“A lot of people run a race to see who is fastest. I run to see who has the most guts, who can punish himself into exhausting pace, and then at the end, punish himself even more.” - (Can anyone guess who?)\n\n📸: @vroomshoots', '“Just attack the race and smash it as hard as you can. If you die, you die brave.” - these were the final words I said aloud to myself on my warmup jog last night, after spending the last 3 weeks hobbling around with a tight hip (just look at my strava) and wondering whether I’d be recovered enough for the one race I organise in my home country every year. Thankfully, my fitness did not betray me, and I did not die: I ran a PB and under the old Singapore record (6:52) with a 6:50 finishing time.\n\nTruth be told I was slightly annoyed at myself for not getting a sub 6min 50sec 2.4km last night. The @pocarisg 2.4km only comes around once a year so you don’t get many chances to get it right. I was in good shape in June/July but a hip strain at the end of July has made August a month of very little training. Last week, I was limping on the track, and had to cut a workout short after just 1km and almost pulled the plug on this race, but decided to wait it out. It’s a miracle I managed to run like I did last night, but it also shows that in running it’s often mind over matter.\n\nAny disappointment at failing to go below my arbitrary goal of 6:50 however soon dissipated once seeing my supporters and loved ones after the race. They don’t really care about track, or how fast or slow I ran, and if anything are just proud and impressed by how much I attacked the race with everything I had. That provides the perspective I need to file this away as a good race given the circumstances, but more importantly, an effort I can be proud of and one I will look to emulate in the future.\n\nOften I look back at races and wish I attacked earlier. Last night I know I took the lead early and aggressively squeezed every ounce out of my legs, but just didn’t have it on the day for my ‘A’ goal. \n\nNothing much left to do then, then to get in even better shape, and smash it again next year!', 'Grabbed the lead super early and gave this race everything I had today. Was thrilled to go under the old Singapore record for 2.4km - 6:50! \n@gunnerjee stuck close and used his 1500m speed to pip me at the death - well played.

Thereafter, Jeevaneesh will go to Melbourne 🇦🇺 to pursue a master’s degree in engineering, Ethan will go to Wisconsin 🇺🇸 for a degree in computer science, and I will return to London 🇬🇧 to continue my law degree.\n\nJeevaneesh is one of the most disciplined and “guai” athletes I know - he lives, reads, breathes and watches running. He particularly excels at the 1500m distance, having a personal best of 4:00, from this year’s SEA Games final.\n\nEthan is one of the most talented young 1500m runners Singapore has ever had, as well as one of the best teammates I’ve ever had, always doing his part to help when the going gets tough in training. He has a personal best of 4:04, also from this year’s SEA Games final.\n\nWe started training together at the start of 2021 under the constraints of COVID-19 lockdown, with the company of many of our fantastic training partners and Coach Steven Quek. Both these guys played a huge part of the 5,000m and marathon national records I set in 2021, and I also dragged them to their best ever 1500m performances that qualified them for the SEA Games for the first time (in 1500m).\n\nThank you for being amazing friends and training partners. Here’s to one last good race together at the @pocarisg 2.4km Challenge!

Go for longevity!”\n\nHe also set an audacious target for me to shoot for - 2hr 15min in the marathon.\n\nAlways keep someone like this close who will not hesitate to tell you the truth and keep you honest so you will never be complacent, and always shoot to be the best version of yourself. 💪🏼', 'What a 30min run in Singapore looks like. 💦 🔥', 'Dear Singapore, remember it’s work hard play hard not just work hard.

Nick Impey (@nick_impey) of Britain accidentally tripped Singapore's Ethan Yan (@ethanyan01) after running too close behind, resulting in Ethan losing his balance and falling to the ground.\n\nNick and the runners behind thankfully managed to hurdle over Ethan and avoid further accidents, but Ethan, a favourite to win the race, was in dead last and way off the lead by this point.\n\nAs seen in the video, Nick not only looked back to check if Ethan was ok, but came to a complete stop, turned around and encouraged Ethan to get back on his feet and into the race. Nick even voluntarily dropped into last place and encouraged Ethan from behind. Dropping back to help Ethan easily cost Nick about 5 seconds plus all his momentum.\n\nNick eventually overtook every runner except one to finish in second place (7min 13sec), just 1 second behind the winner, Shaun Goh. It would be fair to say that Nick sacrificed his chance at winning in the name of sportsmanship.\n\nEthan also displayed good fighting spirit to finish the race, running fast enough (7:17) to qualify for the elite race on August 20 - It promises to be a good race with record holder Jeevaneesh (@gunnerjee) and myself. He has also graciously praised Nick for his act of sportsmanship on Instagram.\n\nIn a day and age where winning is often prioritised over values, Nick's sportsmanship deserves to be celebrated and recognised, as does Ethan's fighting spirit.

It’s a classic sleep metric, looking at the hours of rest and sleep cycles, then comparing them to the previous 28 days to see how well one has rested. \n\nAutonomic Nervous System Charge measures how well the autonomic nervous system calmed down during the first hours of sleep compared to the usual level over the previous 28 days.\n\nThe combination of these two scores makes Polar’s Nightly Recharge very comprehensive.

This, in turn, activates the body\'s healing response in treating acute or chronic musculoskeletal injuries from\ntendinopathies to osteoarthritis.\n\nWhile the technical jargon may sound kinda out of this world and 20min may seem like a short time but that’s the beauty of it and it’s working from inside out, at the cellular level.

Thanks Conor!\n\nSo I’m gonna unabashedly celebrate these running moments - especially since at my (not so tender) age - every (especially open/non age-group) podium is huge! \n\nGrateful.\n\n#lovelivelaughrun #RunWithJoy #NewBalanceSG #PolarSingapore #SundayShadesCo #theCHEEsiblings #TeamRDRC #RaceDay', 'Trifactor🥈10.5km - Learning to race again.

BUT i’ve been keeping my eyes peeled for new versions of their seasonal ricotta toast! saw that they are having a rock melon one now and got so excited!!! it’s one of my favourite fruits 😋\n\ntheir ricotta toast always seem to use such interesting toppings which are uncommonly used (apple jelly? sour plum powder? jackfruit? rhubarb?)! where else would you see all these!! can’t wait to see what other innovative combinations the team comes up with 😍😍😍!!! \n\n✨𝐑𝐢𝐜𝐨𝐭𝐭𝐚 𝐓𝐨𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐑𝐨𝐜𝐤 𝐌𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐧 ($11)\ntoast was fluffy with a slight chew! could taste the sour tang thats so iconic of sourdough!! the mint leaves adds a refreshing taste at the end of each bite. the sweetness from the rock melon jam with the creaminess from the ricotta and the sweet-sour taste from the sour plum powder sprinkled on top was really an experience!!! theres so many things going on on the plate but yet they all balance out so well with so many textures as well😍🤩😋😋!!! so beautiful 💯💯!!\n\n✨𝐈𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞 ($6)', '📍Bloom Coffee\n\ngot here after taking a 40 mins walk with @nibsandgobs ahhahaa. really lovely vibes! a little out of the way but perfect for a solo date, to read or pitstop after a run!

(ohno i accidentally chao ta the top part when toasting but idk if it’s because i put too long in the toaster because the lava cld’ve been oozier and warmer? and if i put in the toaster longer for a more melted oozy lava, it would prob become a black tea bun instead of green tea bun...) anyway, i’m obviously gonna buy this again and can’t wait to try it refrigerated and microwaved!!! 🍵🍞\n9.6/10⭐️⭐️', '📍odetoat \n\nreally satisfied and happy that i bought the set because @odetoat really nailed the aesthetic visuals and taste! \n\nchunky triple cheese cookie\nreally screams CHEESE, thicc and chewy✨ the cookie was savoury + salty + sweet and with how it can be eaten cold, such a unique combination and taste profile!! the cheese cracker added that extra crunch in contrast to the dense chewy cookie. there’s also cheese chocolate in the cookie?!?! which is really interesting and i loved it! 🧀🧀🧀\n8/10\n\ncheesecake tub\ni actually prefer this to the cookie! the cheesecake tub fr stole my heart. its was so RICHH & CREAMY i literally could not stop eating and was so glad that i bought 2 sets because i’m telling you 1 set wasn’t enough because of how addictive it was. i found myself constantly going back to the fridge to have a few more mouthful of it. was suppose to share with my fam but i finished like 1 and a half tub of it.... love the generous layers of oat crumble and not to mention, this cheesecake tub is made of rice cream! can’t express how much i love the cheese and its creaminess , richness, thickness wOW 😩🤍\n9/10\n\nthis is the last week to get them so get ready as order opens today @ 7.30pm!!! go support @odetoat now🏃🏻\u200d♀️🏃🏻\u200d♀️', '📍glasshouse\n\nthis visit was actually quite long ago oops.. anyway i remember wanting to try their basque burnt cheesecake but i went at 5+pm and their kitchen closed at 5pm so i could only chose from a few pastries left and i tried their babka\n\nbabka [$7]: \nthe babka was more towards the soft and chewier, dense side rather than those airy soft fluffy bread. it was filled with the right amount of bittersweet dark chocolate swirls! it was nicely warmed up too. they also drizzled chocolate sauce and topped it with cornflakes, sunflower seeds, almond flakes and hazelnut. the toppings really gave that extra crunch to the bread which was amazing!! \n8/10\n\niced white [$6.50]\nthe coffee was strong yet not toooo bitter. if you prefer your coffee acidic, this is for you ☕️☕️', '📍lucid\n\nmaple scone [$6]:\nthe interior was so fluffy and moist, overall p crumbly i love the texture of it. the scone was really fragrant and buttery SO GOOD. there’s a layer of maple glaze which wasn’t very strong so it’s not that sweet. it’s served with miso butter and whip cream which complements the scone really well because of the sweet salty combi !! tbh i think the miso butter can be less salty but still find it a pretty good pairing with the scone and the whip cream was so light & addictive. i couldn’t stop eating it together w the scone even though i was so full from lunch 😩 legit the best scone i’ve had so far!!!! go try @alucidspace maple scone if you haven’t!!\n9/10\n\nwe also ordered \n~ iced white with fresh milk\n~ iced white with oat milk\n~ iced hojicha latte\n\noverall, good vibes and so aesthetic :>> will go back for their maple scones hehe and also will try other bakes and their toasts too!!', 'hi guys!!\n\nfinally a new post after 1 month plus\npretty busy and i’ve so many backlogs and reviews🤧😬but yes i’ll try to post more often now :>\n\novernight oats (soaked in milk) with chia seed, banana, walnuts, macadamia nuts & lotus biscoff sauce [a must hehe] \n\nhope y’all have a great week ahead 🤍🤍', '📍nipong naepong @ 313 somerset\n\nthis korean-fusion restaurant is AMAZING because this was the 4th time going there and everything i tried so far was so good esp the sweet potato pizza😙👌🏻 the portion for every dish was generous and i guess the price is worth it for the quantity and quality you get!!!! \n\nhere’s a special mention for the famous sweet potato pizza because this is an old pic i took at my previous previous visit!!\n\nni pizza - sweet potato [$19.90?] ✨\noh my god i’m telling you guys PLS.

201,springandsugar,"['🦦✨\n📍Mr. Coconut\n🥥Bubble Coconut ($5.80 for Large)\n\nSo the Bubble Coconut is essentially the liquid form of their famed Coconut Shake but the one I got tasted pretty diluted. I’d say just stick to the latter, much more delicious and cheaper too. 🤓🤟', '🦦✨\n📍Yishun Park Hawker Centre\n🍛Hakka Tofu Bowl ($5.50)\n\nSo I’ve seen mixed reviews about this tofu bowl but I really thought it was good. It was fusion done right to me and I’ve since had many more bowls on separate occasions while enjoying them all the same.\n\nI was a little apprehensive of the mayonnaise at first, because how well could it go with something that is in reminiscence of 擂茶饭? But then I had a go at it and I thought it was something that the bowl couldn’t do without. 😳\n\nThe fried chicken pieces were kinda like the highlight of the meal. They remind me of karaage, but stuffed in crispy fried tofu puff that were made even better with their mayonnaise and sweet chilli dip. 🤤', '🦦✨\n📍Sushiro, Causeway Point\n\nSometimes I do crave for a convenient, fuss free sushi dinner and Sushiro seems to tick all the boxes for me. 👌\n \n🍳Energy Boost Inari ($2.20)\n🥩A5 Miyazaki Galbi Beef ($4.80)\n🐟Salmon with Basil Cheese ($2.20)\n🥩A5 Miyazak Roast Beef ($4.80)\n🐟Premium Salmon Belly ($3.20)\n🐟Marinated Broiled Salmon ($2.20)\n\nMy favourite of the lot was definitely the Energy Boost Inari. Slivers of beef and onion with a quarter of seasoned egg were all flavourful. The sushi was definitely on the sweeter side because of the tofu pocket but I enjoyed it regardless.\n\nBoth the A5 Miyazaki Beef sushi weren’t shabby too, they were pretty tender. I liked the accompanying sauce on the roast beef although they were nothing to shout about.\n\nThe Salmon with Basil Cheese had so much potential. I thought the herbaceous notes of the basil sauce was yummy but it was too heavy with the torched salmon and cheese. A touch more basil would do the trick though.', '🦦✨\n📍Playmade\n\U0001f9cbChrysanthemum Tea with Chrysanthemum Pearls at 0% Sugar Level\n\nThis might be a case of chrysanthemum overdose but their chrysanthemum pearls are so good. They are fragrant and their pearls have a good kind of chew that’s unique to Playmade. 🌼\n\nEven at 0% sugar level, my drink was lightly sweetened and perfect for me.. Although I must say I’m the kind of hate unsweetened teas from bubble tea shops. 🌚', '🦦✨\n📍Techno Edge Canteen, NUS Faculty of Engineering\n🍛Ayam Hijau Nasi Lemak\n\nI got this nasi lemak because I thought the butterfly pea rice looked really pretty! Alas, it was covered by that huge slab of chicken thigh and omelette when it arrived. 😂\n\nNot complaining because I enjoyed both proteins as far as regular lunches go.. And the green chilli sambal was lovely with the chicken heh. 👌', '🦦✨\n📍Marche Movenpick, 313 Somerset\n🍕Smoked Duck Hoisin Pizza ($22.90)\n\nThink Peking Duck but in a crispy, thin crust pizza form! With tomatoes and cheese! Although they could be a little more generous with the smoked duck, I enjoyed this sweet and savoury combination a lot. And I’ll definitely order this again the next time I visit. 🤓', '🦦✨\n📍MacPherson Minced Meat Noodles\n🍜Minced Meat Noodles ($4.50)\n\nThis was no doubt a good bowl of 肉脞面 that I enjoyed. The vinegared sauce mix was fragrant, punchy and had a good kick, although I got myself another tablespoon of vinegar for good luck. But that’s just me, I’ve always been the ✨多✨醋少辣 kind of person.\n\nThe minced meat, pork slices and pork liver slivers tasted really fresh too but what I love the most was that bowl of soup. It looked unassuming but it was anything so. It was flavourful yet light and paired well with the saucy bowl of noodles.\n\nI’ll definitely go for the 小碗面 next time! More soup and more ingredients means more goodness. And it seems like they serve 面线 too so I’m looking forward. 🤗', '🦦✨\n📍So Good Char Chan Tang, Midview City\n\nNot my first visit to So Good but there are still so many dishes that I want to try, like their Curry Beef Brisket Rice! But probably not at Midview City, at least a couple of their staff were incredibly rude. 🙄\U0001f972\n\n🍅Baked Tomato Pork Chop Rice ($9.50)\n🍖Twin Combination Meat Rice with Roast Duck and Roast Pork ($7.50)\n🍲Macaroni with Luncheon Meat and Fried Egg ($4.50)\n🍳Scrambled Egg Thick Toast ($3.50)\n🧈Polo Bun with Butter ($2.30)\n☕️Hong Kong Style Milk Tea ($2.20)\n\nMy favourite of the lot would definitely be the Baked Tomato Pork Chop Rice! I’m wondering if the baking actually made any difference to the dish, but I loved the tangy and slightly sweet tomato sauce! The pork chop itself was also tender and served generously. 🤤\n\nThe Polo Bun with Butter was good too! Really fluffy bun, with a good amount of crispy sweet crust and chilled butter; this could be my favourite polo bun in Singapore. 🤝\n\nThe Scrambled Egg Thick Toast on the other hand was just alright. I had it once with my bread untoasted and I much preferred that heh. The egg here was really silky and not a smidge overcooked but it could really do well with a little salt and pepper.. I’m pretty sure it was unseasoned. 🤪', '🦦✨\n📍Old Hen Coffee\n\nHappy International Coffee Day everyone! Just leaving a photo of my favourite cold brews ever, when they were still in their OG bottles.\n\n☕️Cold Mocha ($7.50)\n🍫Valrhona Dark Cocoa ($6.50)\n\nBoth of them, along with their white cold brew, were so good! They were thick, velvety smooth with just the right amount of sweetness. Technicalities aside since I’m far from being a coffee connoisseur, I just love how they tasted. 💯🤤', '🦦✨\n📍Merci Marcel Orchard, Palais Renaissance\n\nOne of my favourite places to be at; I love their vibes, their energy and their food.\n\n🥟Ravioles de Royans ($18)\n🐟Beetroot Carpaccio & Wild Trout Gravlax ($11)\n🥐Croissant ($3.50)\n☕️Mocha ($6)\n\nThe ravioli and cured trout might seem like an unlikely pairing but they went so well together! The vodka and honey marinade of the trout was a sweet and a little acidic and it complimented the richness of the pasta so well. 🥺\n\nThe croissant was not the very best but I enjoyed it enough! It wasn’t stale and was pretty light. I had my fair share of worse ones at higher price points so I would definitely order this again. 🤟', '🦦✨\n📍Greendot, Northpoint City\n\nI usually avoid cai pngs like the plague and I can never seem to vibe with vegetables. But I make exceptions for Greendot and it is one of the only few places that makes me crave for plants and fungi. 👀🌚\n\n🍱Bento with 2 Mains and 1 Green ($10.90)\n🍚Brown Rice\n🍄Gong Bao Mixed Mushroom (+$1)\n🧆Sweet and Sour Soya Nuggets\n🥘Vegetable Curry\n\nI was so contented with my choices because all of them were so yummy and up my alley! Very flavourful but I don’t find them too oily like how some regular cai pngs can get. Maybe because they don’t drench the sauce all over my rice?\n\nBut ah, I felt a bit sian at the soup because even Greendot can’t make me appreciate dried seaweed. I would much prefer their regular winter melon soup but it just wasn’t my day. 😔', '🦦✨\n📍Tamago EN, Causeway Point\n🍛Beef Stew Omu Rice ($16.90)\n\nSo it is all about their eggs here and I thought mine was pretty decent! It was silky and tasted fresh, although nothing too mind blowing. The beef chunks were tender enough and the demi-glace was flavourful, just a tad too salty for me. I did change my butter rice to plain ones and I thought they went better that way heh. 🤝', '🦦✨\n📍Don Don Donki, Jem\n\nThey might not serve the best Japanese food around but it’s usually very value for money! Their servings are huge and I always feel so contended shopping for some noms there. 😌\n\n🍱Mega Bento Salmon and Chicken Karaage ($11.80)\n🍗Black Vinegar Chicken Karaage ($5.90)\n🧁Custard Waffle Cakes ($4.90)\n\nI honestly thought the bento was just alright. I’d prefer if chicken and salmon were more tender. Same thing with the Black Vinegar Chicken Karaage, it was a little tough but it’s still a repeat purchase as I really enjoyed the sauce! 👍\n\nBut the best thing on that table was definitely the waffle cakes. I got it because I couldn’t find the elusive Souffle Roll but this was so much better for me. Imagine soft and fluffy sponge with sweet cream filling and luckily, they weren’t too milky. I liked it so much that I could finish four at a go. And I did. 🤤🌚', '🦦✨\n📍Heytea, Westgate\n\U0001f9cbSoymilk Bobo ($7.80)\n\nI thought this cup of milk tea would get a little confusing because there’s just so many things going on at the same time? There’s soymilk cream, soymilk pudding, soybean powder and even taro bobo. But then I took the plunge and got it anyway. And I loved it. 🤭\n\nThe soymilk cream on top was my favourite of them all. It was rich and creamy but not sickly so. And the earthy and roasty notes from the soy bean powder was moreish and simply delightful. 🥺', '🦦✨\n📍7-Eleven\n☕️HY Hot Brew Macadamia Mocha Latte\n\nAs far as bottled coffees go, this was really not that bad after all. Although a little too sweet for my liking, I’ll still drink this willingly to collect even more pretty bottles. 🌚\n\nP.S. Also happy five years to the greatest alter ego there ever is. 😘🤤✌️', '🦦✨\n📍Common Man Coffee Roasters, Fort Canning MRT Station\n🍞Brioche French Toast ($22)\n\nNot the eggiest French toast around, but definitely the softest and fluffiest that I’ve tried! Also loved that sprinkle of ground cinnamon that added some warmth to my toast. 😌', '🦦✨\n📍Homemade 🤲\n🍜Beef Noodles Soup\n\nAlways feeling lucky to have friends who cook really well and even more fortunate to be fed by them! And this precious bowl of beef noodle soup was just too good. Even the lovely noodles were handmade by my friend himself. 🤓', '🦦✨\n📍Denzy, Bishan MRT Station\n\nThis has been on my list to visit for so long but I held it off because I’m just not one to crave for frozen desserts. But damn, these gelatos were enjoyable.\n\n🧇Light and Crispy Waffle with Gelato ($14.10)\n🍨Roasted Bronte Pistachio Gelato\n🍨Whisky and Salted Pecan Brittle Gelato\n\nCame here for the pistachio gelato and I was pretty impressed! It was velvety and the roasted, earthy taste of pistachio came forth. 👍🤩\n\nIt was good but just a tad too sweet and heavy for me. That’s why I actually prefer the whisky gelato! It was less sugary and I loved munching on that generous, yummy brittle for a greater depth of flavour. 🤤\n\nHowever, the waffle was a let down for me. It was a light and crispy waffle indeed but I’m not fond of the batter. It was a little savoury and tasted a little burnt for me.', '🦦✨\n📍MukJja, Novena Regency\n🍜Set A ($40)\n\nBest kind of set meal to order in a Korean Chinese restaurant when you only had a friend with you but y’all just want to try everything! Or maybe it was just me. 🎉🤓\n\nThe tangsuyuk was my favourite! I loved how that whiff of the punchy vinegar attacked my nose and the pork were pretty crispy when it was served too. 🤟\n\nBoth the noodles were very onion forward and I preferred the jjajangmyeon. It was a little more sweet than it was savoury but none too overbearing. Jjamppong on the other hand, was too spicy for me and I couldn’t really taste the depth of the seafood flavour. 😬', '🦦✨\n📍FlagWhite, Beauty World MRT Station\n\nHaving good food after a long hike was exceptionally rewarding indeed! I’m up for more sessions if that means I can be fed happily. 👩\u200d🌾\n\n🍗Chicken Parmigiana ($15)\n☕️Hot Mocha ($6)\n\nThe fried chicken was tender and juicy! The tangy tomato concasse and cheese made me felt like I was having a pizza. But better. Why choose when I can have the best of both worlds? 😎 \n\nAlthough hot mochas might not be the best idea after a 10km hike, the one I had here became my favourite! It left a slight fruity and alcoholic aftertaste and now I am missing it again.\n\nP.S. My tiny regret was forgetting to change the fries for their sweet potato ones but that was all on me. 😟', '🦦✨\n📍Fu Lin Fried Yong Tau Fu, IMM\n🍲Six Pieces Fried with Thick Bee Hoon and Gravy ($7.50)\n\nDiscovered this gem on @auntiekongfoodie’s feed from a while ago and thought that I should try! And definitely no regrets here. 🤟\n\nThis is my kind of yong tau fu because it was anything but healthy. The items were deep fried to a crisp and drenched with a minced meat and mushroom gravy which thankfully, wasn’t too heavily seasoned despite how it looked. 😌', '🦦✨\n📍Meng’s Teochew Beef Kuay Teow, Yishun MRT Station\n🥩Mixed Beef with Tendon ($5)\n\nNot a fan of the usual dark and starchy gravy for my dry beef noodles so I thought I’d give this a try. The crazy mix of soy based sauce, sesame oil and fried shallots with perfectly blanched bean sprouts became my kind of jam indeed. 👌\n\nBeen missing this a little but on my second visit, I found out that it was gone and replaced by a 猪肠粉 stall so fml. 🌚']",0,,,

The precision, the science of it all. How an extra egg can make or break the bake, how sugar affects not just sweetness but texture as well, and how the exact same quantity of ingredients can create a completely different brownie just by the method and duration of the mixing. Ever since then, it’s just been an endless discovery of baking science like the process of beating egg whites, effects of different fat contents in cream, gluten formation in bread, the difference between baking soda and baking powder (ok nerd…..), etc. Food is crazy.\n\nSo ya it feels a little like I’ve come full circle with these buns, and this time with greater success :’)', 'MATCHA HOJICHA MAMMOTH BBANG - Matcha streusel-topped charcoal bread filled with homemade azuki red bean paste and slathered with intense uji matcha ganache, hojicha white chocolate and more azuki bean paste. \n\nMammoth bbangs are huuuuge in Korea (literally n figuratively 🤡) and are basically soboro (streusel) breads filled with bean paste sandwiching some kind of filling.

However, because the sweetness was just perfect and the sponge was soft, it was still a really good swissroll.\n\n• Coconut pandan : (6.5/10) \nThe swissroll with coconut and pandan was light and aromatic.

Those 2 are definitely one of the better pairings as macarons may tend to be overly sweet but these 2 just makes everything better ! 😇\n\n3. Silver moon tea & strawberry \nNormally I wouldn’t go for strawberry flavoured food because they would turn out to be an unpleasant experience (medicine taste) but this surprisingly didn’t taste like it but instead, more of like strawberry jam !

As much as I love my mushroom, I personally felt that this pizza wasn’t really for me as it had a really strong fungi mushroom taste? (If you unds what I mean) The mushroom taste were too overwhelming that it really turns us off. Definitely a no go pizza 😖\n\n• Mentaiko Chitarra : $17.5 (7.2/10)\nAnything mentaiko 💗. Yes my love for Mentaiko remains 😆. This Mentaiko pasta may look plain and boring but it is pack with a full punch of Mentaiko flavour which was super satisfying. Pasta were not overdone and was cooked al-dente ✨. Only downside is that it’s a little too salty 🙃\n\n• Mafalde Cacio e Pepe : $15 (7/10)\nLooks pretty much like homemade pasta with some simple seasoning like pepper , salt and chilli flakes . As simple as it looks, it still tasted good and simple to satisfy that pasta cravings. For someone whom don’t really like your pasta to be drenched in sauce, this is definitely something you should try it out! \n\n• Tagliatelle Bolognese : $16 \n-no comments as I wasn’t able to take beef-\n\nOverall would go back again but only with the burpple (1-1) as their items are a little pricey.\n\n*Do bring your own water or you’ll have to pay $0.50 per cup*', '📍: HVALA, CHIJMES // 111 Somerset\n\n🚇 : City Hall // Somerset MRT \n\n💸 : approx. $10 per pax \n\n📝 : \n• Black Sesame Cake : (7.8/10) $8.80\nThis definitely didn’t disappoint!

It wasn’t too overwhelming but definitely better to share with your friends !\n\n• Honey earl grey hazelnut cake : (6.8/10) $8.80\nLikewise, the sponge were soft and fluffy. However, personally felt this was a little too creamy for my liking and prefer it to have a stronger earl grey taste. Too overwhelming for 3 different components to be together as it overpowers each other thus a no goal for me .\n\n• Ice blended matcha : (7/10) $6?\nOoof excepted this to be slightly diluted or less of a matcha taste but I was totally blown away but the matcha taste as it was packed full of matcha goodness 🤯. Was not sweet which was what I would prefer and it’s blended smoothly thus it deserves a 👍🏻. Only thing was that I personally think it was a little too filling 😆.\n\n• Ice blended Yuzu : (7/10)\nBetter than expected 😊 Was a little skeptical at first as I thought it will be a little too sour for my liking but turns out pretty great. It has the right balance of sweetness, tanginess and it’s really refreshing to quench your thirst on this scorching day ☀️ it also have some bits of yuzu peels in the drink which adds a little more texture and mouthfeel to it 🙃.\n\nOverall felt that everything were a little too pricey that I would visit often but once in a blue moon wouldn’t be a problem 😉', '📍: The Coffee Academics, Raffles City\n\n🚇 : City Hall Mrt \n\n💸 : approx. $25 per pax\n\n📝 : [Burpple 1-1]\n\n• Miso Salmon Pasta : $28 (6.5/10)\nPersonally have not tried miso pasta before so this was a little interesting ? Pasta was cooked to perfection (al-dente) with the sauce infused into it just that maybe they should go lighter on that salt or miso as it’s a little salty but manageable . However, the salmon was a little disappointing as it was overcooked which results it to be slightly too dry and tough for my liking . \n\n• Truffle Portobello Mushroom Pizza : $26\nSuper thin and crispy crust filled with cheese and mushrooms 🙃. A little disappointing for the price as it’s really average and basic that there isn’t nothing to wow about . However thankful that the mushroom taste wasn’t too overpowering 😳.\n\nOverall, a pretty average place but the price of every dish was a little too steep.

I think that would’ve worked a lot better bc the bkt flavour was a bit confusing in a xlb, but nevertheless v exciting to have a plant-based xlb!! 🤩\n⭐️: 7/10\n\n〰️ 𝐏𝐚𝐧-𝐟𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐒𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐡𝐚𝐢 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐏𝐨𝐫𝐤 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐕𝐞𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐁𝐮𝐧 (𝐒$𝟔.𝟗𝟎) - the dough was really soft and the filling was tasty, but it honestly tasted like a vegetable spring roll in bun form. the filling was predominantly vegetables and I couldnt really taste the pork, would have liked it better if it was more sheng jian bao-esque with more meat!

But on the first bite, the flavour was just...lacking?? There was no smokiness and saltiness of the cauliflower like there was previously, it just tasted overwhelmingly of black pepper and tahini - and after awhile it got a bit surfeiting ((we couldn’t finish this)). not sure if it was just an off day or this is the normal standard, but we were really disappointed 😭\n⭐️: 5/10\n\n〰️ 𝐅𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐟𝐞𝐥 𝐛𝐮𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐫 (𝐒$𝟏𝟒) - trying this for the first time and we actually quite liked it!

Our only gripe was that the truffle flavour stayed mainly in the sauce and we couldn’t rly taste it when eating the gyoza. Nonetheless I enjoyed this a lot & the generous serving of cream sauce went rly well with rice!!!\n⭐️: 9/10\n\n〰️ 𝐓𝐏𝐅 𝐓𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐲𝐚𝐤𝐢 𝐒𝐨𝐲 𝐖𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐑𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐁𝐨𝐰𝐥 (𝐒$𝟏𝟏.𝟗𝟎) - we had such a hard time picking a main but since this was a limited special we decided to try it.

It was a slight walk from the nearest train stations but we imagine it’d be nice to just chill with friends there over some food 😌\n\n〰️ 𝐍𝐚𝐨𝐤𝐢 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐚 𝐨𝐚𝐭 𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞 (𝐒$𝟕) - using Naoki Matcha’s Barista Blend, this matcha latte was extremely vibrant in colour, so just by sight, we could tell that it was going to be high-quality matcha 😍 We tried it both slightly sweetened and unsweetened, and preferred the slightly sweetened version as the syrup helped to cut through the bitter matcha but didn't overpower the taste of the matcha! The matcha latte itself had a very nice and rich flavour and was very well balanced, with just the right amount of milk 😋 They use oatly barista which is honestly my FAVOURITE plant milk to use with coffee/matcha bc its vv creamy and doesn't have an overpowering non-dairy milk taste 🤩 Would definitely recommend it to any matcha lover if you love a good, strong cup of matcha! 🍵\n\n〰️ 𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐦 𝐓𝐨𝐟𝐮 𝐂𝐢𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐚 (𝐒$𝟗.𝟗𝟎) - With the lattes, we ordered the Mushroom Tofu Ciabatta for lunch!

It wasnt in the description but this came with some spicy powder over it, so the first few bites at the top was a bit too spicy for me.

The breadstick thing that comes with it tastes like youtiao in crouton form and adds extra fragrance and crunch.

The shao rou was flat and the skin was hard while the char shao was abit cardboard-like. The rice was pretty well cooked but the dark sauce was blend and flavourless.

Honestly, I wasn’t very impressed by the soy sauce chicken because the meat wasn’t super tender and the flavour wasn’t particularly outstanding. However, I quite like the char siew as it was caramelized well and had a good meat/fat ratio. Overall, decent quality roasted meats but not sure whether I will brave the long queues for the stall next time.😵\n\nOverall: 6/10', '📍[Fragrance Bak Kwa]\n\nStill thinking of what CNY goodies to get?

The last time I had this was around 5 years back when it was still located at Beauty World Food Centre and featured on foodking :))) When I heard that they reopened near town, I immediately went when I could and tried their burgers!\n\nFirst off, the decor was retro and the whole place was really vibey. The serving staff were really friendly and we were able to book a table before going there. I had the classic beef burger myself while my friend had the shao rou burger. The beef burger was solid and the patty was thick & juicy. The fries were also crispy and still had the skin intact. \n\nOverall, I really liked the place and I’ll probably go back soon to try their shao rou burger!\n\nOverall: 8.5/10', '📍[Isle’s Eating House]\n\nAddress: 35 Selegie Road #02-08/09/10/11/12 Parklane Shopping Mall 188307\n\nOpening Hours: Mon-Sun 6.30am - 9pm \n\nReview: Had this for lunch instead of my usual caifan (which is delicious btw) but I was quite dissapointed by the roasted meat. First of all, the shao rou wasn’t crispy even though it was 12pm in the afternoon and the meat should still be quite fresh. Secondly, the char siew had a dark brown colour but had no real flavour, it was quite salty but no caramelized flavour. Overall, while the rice & chilli was decent, I probably wouldn’t eat it again :(((\n\nOverall: 5/10', '📍[Zhen Zhu Fang Roasted Delights 珍珠坊香港烧]\n\nAddress: 34 New Market Road #01-1098 People’s Park Food Centre, Singapore 050032\n\nOpening Hours: Mon-Sun 9am - 9pm \n\nReview: I went to Chinatown recently to try out this stall as I read some pretty good reviews online but sadly, it was slightly dissapointing. While the shao rou was crispy and tender, the char siew was pretty meh. While i did like the chilli, the rice was pretty underwhelming. Overall, I probably wouldnt eat this stall again because I rather eat Mala or other better options at People’s Park Food centre. \n\nOverall: 5/10', '📍[Home made shao rou]\n\nMade this shao rou myself recently and I had a lot of fun in the process🤩 The recipe was very easy to follow and the roasted pork was juicy and tender😋 If you wanna know about the recipe, PM me to find out more!\n\nOverall: 10/10', '🥩Wagyu Giveaway🥩 [Closed]\n\nIn collaboration with @yakinikuplaza, we will be giving away 5 sets of prizes (1 grand prize and 4 lucky prizes) this🎄Christmas season.

At the same time, the chao shao was also nothing spectacular and in fact, a bit tough.

The duck skin was super fatty and every bite was exploding with flavour. The duck meat was tender with light hints of herbal notes and not gamey at all. It was so good that I couldn’t stop myself and I almost finished the whole duck in one sitting. As for the cssr, I preferred the shao rou which was still crispy and pretty above average in my books. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed myself - Especially the roasted duck which I would really recommend getting.

I had quite high expectations for this stall but I was quite dissappointed by their roasted meat :( The char siew and shao rou were both quite lacklustre when i had it for lunch unfortunately. I wasn’t very impressed because the char siew was quite cardboard-like while the shao rou was not crispy.

I had the Number 2 which had crispy prosciutto and burrata cheese! The beef patty was perfectly seared and well seasoned with a strong beefy flavour to it. The bun itself was buttery and well toasted & was a good compliment to hold the entire burger. Overall, this is a simple but well executed burger. I would definitely recommend this burger and you would not be dissappointed! \n\nOverall: 8.5/10', '📍[Heng Heng Roasted Delights]\n\nAddress: 204 Serangoon Central Singapore 550204\n\nOpening Hours: Tues-Sun 10.30am - 8.30pm \n\nReview: Had this for lunch and was really impressed by the quality of the char siew and shao rou from this store! The char siew had a really good char and was melt in your mouth 😋 The corner pieces were super well-caramelized and were my favourite! Last but not least, the shao rou was perfectly tender & crisp and had the perfect fat-meat ratio🐷\n\nOverall, if you’re looking for a roast-meat fix, definitely consider this hidden gem at Serangoon!

There aren’t many good zhi char spots in Singapore but I would definitely recommend this spot for it’s value and quality.\n\n👉🏻Chilli Crab & Pepper crab ($19.90 special promo)\nBoth the crab dishes were very fresh, I particularly liked the chilli crab because it was spicy enough and yet still sweet and tangy at the same time. Also, the lala inside was also a nice addition and soaked up a lot of flavour from the sauce. \n\n👉🏻Prawn paste chicken ($12/$18)\nThe chicken wings were crispy and tender which basically hits the spot for har cheong gai! The prawn paste aroma is quite strong and we found it super addictive.\n\n👉🏻Fish Steamboat ($15 special promo/$28 regular price)\nThe steamboat came in a charcoal pot which kept the dish piping hot throughout our meal. The fish was tender and the soup was really tasty with no fishy taste! I really liked the chilli that came along as it was garlicky and tangy which paired very well the fish slices. We were told that they purchased their fish fresh from the market every morning and you can add on pomfret or red snapper to “zhng” (improve) your dish! \n\n👉🏻Lemon grass pork ribs ($15/$20)\nThe pork ribs were quite tender and well seaonsed with a strong lemon grass taste. It is quite similar to korean fried chicken but with some thai elements to it! \n\nOverall: Kwan’s a super solid zhi char stall located in Bugis/Bras Basah area! The dishes are all super high quality and I would definitely recommend this to my friends!\n\nThank you for the invite @kwanszichar !

The queue for the stall was around 10 man strong when i went at 11.45 but the service was really swift and I had my plate of cssr in no time. I think the highlight of this stall is definitely their char siew, the edges were super caramelized and sweet but the less fatty bits of char siew was slightly more tough. For the shao rou and shao ya, they were quite average, the shao rou was not super crispy and the duck was slightly too gamey for my taste. For the rice and chilli, it was quite normal and there’s nothing much to comment about. Overall, I would recommend buying the char siew from this stall, its perfectly charred and tender like no other.\n\nOverall: 6/10', '[Thuan Ji Roasted Delights] ($4.50)\n\nAddress: Blk 61 Telok Blangah Heights, 100061 Singapore\n\nReview: I think this is quite solid neighbourhood stall for cssr! Had it for lunch and the shao rou was crispy and on point🐷 I also loved the tangy chill which went well with the shao rou. The rice was also dry and mixed well with thick dark sauce which was nice but a bit too sweet.

While the sauce was quite garlicky and nice, there’s really nothing special with any of the three meats. The chao shao shao rou and shao ya were all normal and quite luke warm. The shao rou wasn’t crispy and the char shao was dry & the shao ya was quite blend.\n\nOverall, I wouldn’t really go back to this stall. The rice and meat is quite mediocre in my opinion and it costed me $7.50 for 三宝 which is quite expensive. While I think it may appeal to a more old school taste, it’s not really my cup of tea but I’ll still recommend that y’all try it for yourself and come to your own verdict🐷\n\nOverall: 3/10', '[Leong Yeow Famous Waterloo St Chicken Rice] ($4.50)\n\nOpening Hours: 11am to 8pm daily, closed on Sunday. \n\nAddress: 270 Queen St, #01-49, Singapore 180270\n\nReview: I tried some of this from a friend the other day and it was really suprisingly good. I had it at 8pm and the shao rou was honestly not too shabby considering that it was probably roasted in afternoon. The pork was quite fatty and meaty but sadly the skin was crispy already. However, I would say that it would probably taste much better if I had at the stall itself so I would rate it quite highly taking into account the timing and freshness. Overall, i would probably go back again to try it fresh in the afternoon.\n\nRating: 6.5/10', '[Choon Kee Roasted Delights] ($4)\n\nOpening Hours: 10.30am to 3pm daily, closed on Wednesday.\n\nAddress: 505 Beach Road #01-74, Golden Mile Food Centre, Singapore 199583\n\nReview: This is one of the hidden gems that I’ve discovered recently and I really love it! I had this at lunch today and i actually cut the shao rou myself which explains the even sizes HAHA🐷 Extra tip here is to try dabaoing your shao rou and eating it with english mustard- the mustard really cuts through the fats and elevates the taste!!\n\nI had shao rou char shao and shao ya - And I think that the most outstanding one is definitely the char shao. It was super sweet and fatty which a light char making it really impeccable. The shao rou and shao ya were also quite decent and the duck skin was especially fragrant. \n\nOverall, quite a suprising discovery at Golden Mile FC aka Army Market. The next I’m there, I’ll definitely struggle choosing between this and the hokkien mee/chicken rice/burger which are all excellent options😤\n\nRating: 8/10', '[碳烤黑叉烧] ($4.20)\n\n448 Clementi Avenue 3 Singapore 120448 #01-15\n\nShort Review- I think the char siew is pretty good but nothing amazing - they were also quite stingy on the portion and I ran out of meat before I finished the rice. \n\nOverall, I think it’s quite pricey at $4.20 for only char shao so I wouldn’t eat it again. However, I would act recommend their noodles instead because iirc, their noodles and wanton are actually pretty good so my take is to buy the noodles > rice 🐷.\n\n📈:5/10', '📍120 Bukit Merah Lane 1, #01-27 Alexandra Village Food Centre, Singapore 150123\n\nOpening Hours: Mon-Sun 8.30am-2.30pm, closed Wed & Thurs\n\nReview: I had this stall last sunday at Alexandra Food Village. I actually intended to have Lau Phua Chay a pretty popular stall which is often featured in articles but I was intrigued by this stall due to the long queue. I told myself why not and proceeded to queue for it 😤. I actually planned to have rice but when i reached the front of the queue i saw a sign that said that they ran out of rice and I had to get noodles instead 😭.\n\nBefore I go in depth, I just wanna preface that the tldr is that the store was actually disappointing and that I wouldn’t go back for it again. First, the two roasted meat were quite average and nothing to get excited over. The char shao was a bit tough and there was no char or sweetness to it while the shao rou was not very crispy. While the shao rou was quite fatty, it was not crispy and tasted quite flat. \n\nNoodles + chilli - the noodles itself was also not very special. It had no flavour and tasted quite plain which did help the dish at all. The chilli was very normal and there’s nothing much to describe about it.\n\nOverall, I was quite disappointed because i queued around 30 mins and tbvh I think that any random store around my neighbourhood would probably taste better than this.\n\n📈: 3/10', '[华鸡同鸭讲港式烧腊] ($4)\n\n📍 269 Queen Street #01-237, 180269 Singapore\n\nOpening Hours: Mon - Sun 10:00 AM - 8:00 PM\n\nThis review is on one of my fav stalls in Singapore! It’s one of the og stalls that made me create this insta acc 😤 It’s quite an unassuming stall opposite the 四马路 temple and along the same stretch as the famous Rong Liang cssr. I rly love this stall and there was one week last year where I ate here 4 times in one week!\n\nBack to the review proper: This stall can actually be quite inconsistent at times, somethings the char siew is too fatty and other times, the shao rou is not crispy. But most of the time, the hack is to order their 三宝饭 for $5 so you can all three roasted meats (shao rou, char shao and shao ya).\n\nOn the good days, all three can be super on point! Firstly, the shao rou will be crispy and fatty. Secondly, the char shao will be caramelize and charred perfectly. Lastly, the shao ya will be fatty with a light crispy skin😋\n\nRice and chilli- normally the rice is quite normal and nothing to rave about. But the chilli on the other hand is pretty good, it’s the garlic and lime chilli which helps to cut through the jelakness of the roasted meat. \n\nOverall, this is one of more underrated stalls in Singapore that no one really knows I feel🐷 TBVH, I’ve been there a few times last week but they were closed both times and I’m abit worried that they are closed for good haha😭 If it really is closed then this shall be my parting post \U0001f972\n\n📈: rating: 8.5/10', '[Char Siu Lang]($5)\n\n📍 Jalan Bukit Merah, #01-5134 Blk 2, Singapore 150002\n\nOpening Hours: Mon-Sun 11am-6.30pm, closed on Wed\n\nReview: This stall is quite hyped on the internet and has a pretty good story (owner won 1M lottery💸a few years back and decided to full time cssr instead). I went on a Sunday afternoon around 12pm where there was a short queue. I actually order 三拼饭 (SPF) instead of my normal cssr because I wanted to try the duck as well but to my surprise, they only served chicken🐓instead of duck.\n\nRoasted meats- I think the roasted meats were slightly below my expectations😣. The chicken was quite tender but nothing out of the world. I actually ordered 半肥 for my char siew because I liked it slight more fatty. I think one thing quite commendable was that all the pieces given were actually perfectly balanced with a good ratio of fat to meat🤩. However, while the ratio was good, I did not find the char siew to be exception! There was no strong char flavour and it was not also super tender. While fatty, the fats were not really rendered and did not melt in my mouth. Lastly, the Shao Rou decent with a good crunch but had no x-factor- it was not super fragrant or crunchy.🤭\n\nRice + Chilli- I think one positive note is that the rice and chilli here was really good. The rice was chicken rice and was perfectly cooked. While many cssr places ignore their rice, I could tell that this place really put effort into their rice.

213,sgfoodventure,"['school has been really busy so far and i’m still unprepared for my upcoming exams 😭 \n\nshown in pic is vietnamese spring roll at Cô Chung which is located at plaza sing! I really love how fresh and delicious it is. I won’t recommend their pho bc the noodles they use is actually the normal kway teow instead of the authentic pho noodles. (would rather travel to vietnam for a bowl of pho but covid doesn’t allow😭)', 'i always order their king fone cheezo tea but decided to try something different, which is their brown sugar boba\n\nBROWN SUGAR BOBA\nwas disappointed bc honestly nothing special and I’d still go for their King Fone Cheezo which is much more unique and delicious', 'LEMON TART \n\nfell in love with the creamy dreamy lemon flavoured filling on my first bite as the cream was wonderfully sweet and sour at the same time (but it’s more on the sour side). The tart was so elegant and it’s indeed delightful for afternoon tea. not forgetting the lemon curd filling which was really good and it’s been indelible in my mind up till now 🥰\n\nVerdict: 9/10 🧚', 'pricey but suuuuper duper delicious 🥰 it’s officially one of my fav sushi place in sg!!! first time trying in and i already fell in love with it ♥️', 'mad love for pasta 😍🥰♥️', 'fun fact: any food with egg usually tastes good 🥰🍳🥚', 'been wanting to try this since Jan this year but was lazy to get as there’s always queue at the orchard outlet but I finally got it today at the nex one!!\n\nAVOCADO COCONUT \nwow the texture was so smooth, thick and creamy and I love how you can adjust the sweetness level to your liking! indeed a healthy way to quench your thirst and it’s super refreshing. it’s also perfect on a hot day ☀️called for less ice but it was still mostly filled with ice 🥺prefer if they are not so overly generous with their ice though HAHAHAH', 'Chanced upon this cafe while catching up with a friend from my alma mater yesterday. We both opted for the $10 promotion set which includes coffee and cake only. \n\nORH NEE CAKE \nWas initially deciding between matcha and chocolate but the staff said that this was the most delicious one but I was quite doubtful at first since it’s a very rare flavour. I really love this the taste is so authentic.\n\nWHITE COFFEE \nAm not a coffee person though HAHAH (still prefer tea!)', 'i think this covid situation is making me explore more bakeries. i actually didn’t know this bakery sells mentaiko mochi which is pretty interesting but i still prefer their cream puff. classic.', 'didn’t expect the queue to be so long but i guess it was surely worth the wait!\n\nLOX ($12)\nI didn’t know they had assorted flavours for their bagels but I chose the plain one since it was my first time. They were very generous with their ingredients, especially the salmon 😍🥰 Despite the bagel being huge, it wasn’t enough for me because it tasted so good and I actually wanted more 🥺 The bagel was not as warm when I reached home so it doesn’t taste as good already 😥\n\nVerdict: 9/10 🧚', 'throwback to weeks ago when my friends and I walked from labrador park mrt all the way to vivocity and it took us close to an hour but overall was a great experience with great company! ♥️ we also got to try different good food on that day and ticked off our wishlist! indeed a fruitful day hehe', 'was a great day out with my ex colleagues and we had impromptu drinking session HAHAH I love the drinks \n\nHOT PINK PALOMA ($14)\nApparently didn’t know what to order because I’ve never drank at bars / clubs before (the only times I drink are either at chalet or at my friends house and we usually drink hard liquor instead of cocktail) so I requested for the most recommended version and eventually got this! I LOVE how it’s a little sweet but mostly sour because of the lime but the aftertaste feels abit like chinese medicine. or is it because I rarely drink cocktails? HAHAH\n\nVerdict: 8/10 🧚', 'the food were SOOOO DELICIOUS i actually dont mind travelling to tanjong pagar again for their slightly pricey food. in fact I love almost everything I ordered from this restaurant 😍\n\nJAJANGMYEON ($10)\nnot surprised that this tasted great since they’re already known for their jjajangmyeon\n\nHAEMULPAJEON ($20)\nreally glad that they’re super generous for their seafood, gotta admit its abit starchy \n\nSAMGAETANG ($18)\na LITTLE disappointed with this as i didn’t taste any glutinous rice which is usually supposed to be an essential in samgaetang but at least the taste was there and they were generous with the ginseng too\n\nVerdict: 9.8/10 🧚', 'just realised this is my first ramen post 🥺 HAHAH anyways was a great catchup with my ex colleagues! \n\nORIGINAL BUTAO KING ($13.90)\nTheir tonkotsu pork broth was smooth, aromatic and incredibly flavourful, which I can see why they’re award winning. Like other typical ramen restaurants, their ramen are also customisable. The pork belly were rather thin though. Unfortunately they were not as generous when it comes to the pork belly and noodles. But I’ll still go back there to try their other flavours! \n\nVerdict: 9.5/10 🧚', 'rlly mad love for tanuki and donburi 🥺 just look at the number of donburi posts I have so far 🥰🥰🥰', 'i really love cafe food ♥️\n\nFRESH SEA PRAWN AGLIO OLIO ($16)\nThe perfectly cooked al dente pasta was served warm and it had the right amount of saltiness. They were generous with their prawns which were thoughtfully shelled too 😍 However when it comes to finishing the pasta the bottom of the plate can be quite oily. \n\nVerdict: 9/10 🧚', 'CARROT CAKE ($6)\nWas looking forward to this because it looked really gorgeous but it turned out to be too sweet for my liking and was nothing special. Portion was also a tad too small. \nVerdict: 5/10 🧚', 'BISCOFF COOKIE ($4.90)\nThis was filled with like 70% chocolate sauce I love how generous they are! Would prefer if they don’t add caramel though\n\nVerdict: 7/10 🧚', 'TRUFFLE & MUSHROOM PASTA ($16)\nTheir Japoli Kitchen store serves truffle and mushroom pasta, which was a disappointment to me. I expected airport food to taste at least above average. I couldn’t even taste any truffle, and the mushroom was not how I expected it to be. 😢 It felt more like a normal mushroom pasta instead. The noodles were acceptable but I’ll definitely not get this again. \nVerdict: 2/10 🧚', 'pricey but really good!!!!! ♥️', 'LEMON MERINGUE PIE ($8.50) 🍋\nAlways dislike desserts with lemon but since it was highly recommended I decided to try it. The lemon was smooth and creamy, while the sugar will leave a sweet taste resonating in your mouth. No regrets. 👍\n\nPANCAKE WITH ICE CREAM DOUBLE - COOKIES AND CREAM & CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE ($13.50) \nBoth pancakes and ice cream were so amazing I fell in love with it instantly and rn this is officially one of my fave cafes in sg. I especially like the chocolate truffle as they were rich and creamy but the cookies and cream were quite ordinary though. I actually love how they provide chocolate sauce (always an essential when it comes to desserts!) Verdict: 9.5/10 🧚', 'Was out with my friends yesterday and we finally got to tick this off our wishlist after the longest time 🤩\n\nTRUFFLE MAC & CHEESE ($12)\n\nI’m so glad I’ve finally tried this! Both the truffle taste and smell were strong enough and the mac and cheese was nicely cooked as well! The portion was alright too. I actually dislike how they serve it in an aluminium foil pan (as it kinda defeats the purpose of eating a well known mac and cheese in a restaurant)\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10 🧚', 'someone bring me back to hong kong so i can enjoy their delicious street food ♥️', 'SALMON KAISEN ($16.90)\nI’ve eaten Tanuki Raw since a few years back and would like to comment that their portions have decreased significantly. 😔 The portion now looks a lot more miserable as compared to that of the past. But I find it great that there’s salmon sashimi, aburi salmon belly, mentaiko seared salmon sashimi, cubed spicy salmon and ikura all in this bowl. The salmon is really fresh and delicious! Would still recommend to go during lunch / student promotion as it will be more worth it\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10 🧚', 'TROPICAL PIZZA ($16)\nShown in picture is the tropical pizza from Japoli Kitchen. Honestly don’t find anything special about this. It’s just your typical Hawaiian pizza but other pizzeria are much better in making them. The pizza is also very thin, hence not worth it. But I’d still go back and try their mentaiko and truffle flavours!\n\nVerdict: 3/10 🧚', 'Went to OverEasy at their Fullerton Outlet and I really love their interior design. This stylish American diner simply screams insta-worthy. 🤩 Even if you sit outside their restaurant, you get to enjoy the view of Singapore’s world-famous skyline. \nTHE “TO-DIE-FOR” BURGER ($26)\nHere’s another good burger place in Singapore besides Shake Shack! The meat was tender and juicy, the fries were crispy and great. Buns were fluffy. Simply a gorgeous burger. \nOVEREASY MOJITO ($18)\nFirst time trying mojito and I already fell in love with it. It’s very yummy and you’d want more of it! It has this perfect balance of flavour. \nVerdict: 9/10 🧚 (because pricey)', 'BURRITO BOWL ($10.90)\n\nOrdered the one with brown rice and grilled chicken. There were also other ingredients included like Australian Jack Cheese, vegeterian black beans, house-made corn chips, Pico de Gallo and House-blend salsa. Some of the ingredients were not very fresh tbh. I wanted to add guacamole but they said it was unavailable. 🥺 I find the price quite reasonable, considering the fact that it’s quite filling and it’s also healthy. The waiting time wasn’t long too!\n\nVerdict: 8/10 🧚', 'I just love japanese food', 'When I was first introduced to @hoshinocoffeesg , I knew the food was gonna be great. Their menu consists of nice range of desserts like soufflé pancake and french toasts! \nSTRAWBERRY FRENCH TOAST ($12.80) 🍓\n\nI ordered this on my first visit as the menu stated it as special recommendation so it was definitely gonna be a safe choice for me. When I first tried it, wow, it was YUMMY! The level of sweetness was perfect. The french toast was crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. \nFRENCH TOAST ($9.80)🍞 I’m not someone who loves to eat especially sweet stuffs, and I feel that this level of sweetness for this is just nice! One thing I dislike about this is that they mix the ice cream with the warm french toast so the extreme temperature difference is not really good, especially for sensitive teeth 🙇\u200d♀️ Their service was actually quite slow, I had to wait for at least 20-30 mins for my order to arrive. 😞😢 I admit that the food at Hoshino Coffee can be a little pricey but at least there’s quality! 🤩 Suitable for foodie couples who wanna have lovely desserts in classy restaurants 🥰\n\nVerdict: 8/10 🧚', 'good pancakes make me happy', ""I don't just like Mickey-shaped food... I love it!!!"", 'No words needed 🥰☕️', 'ordered both their cream cheese beef burger and chicken hot dog. let me tell you, they were both suuuuuuper duper good!!! 🤩', 'Who knew that there’d be a sushi counter right inside a supermarket like Cold Storage?! This mini counter is tucked right at the corner of Cold Storage at Takashimaya, Ngee Ann City for those who are curious. They serve a nice range of sushi, sashimi and donburi.\n\nSALMON DON ($19)\n\nTried their salmon don and was really happy that they included a generous amount of salmon and ikura inside 🤩 I mean, just look at those thicc, succulent pieces of raw salmon 😫 Both the salmon and ikura were really really fresh! \nAs the sushi counter is rather small, there are very limited seats. If I remember correctly there’s around 6 seats only? I’ll definitely recommend those who love Japanese food to patronise this place as they really have quality. \nVerdict: 9.8/10 🧚', 'I love the interior design of their cafe and their open setting even though there are limited seating capacity. I also love how they depend more on natural lightings instead. Oh and not forgetting their toilet, it was so minimalistic, beautiful and cool at the same time! If I remember correctly there’s a bidet in the toilet? Almost the whole toilet was white in colour which is really pretty and stylish! \nICED CAFFE LATTE ($8)\nI’m not a coffee person but I found this good and smooth. I honestly don’t find anything fantastic about it though.\n\nOverall a pleasant experience, but I wouldn’t go all the way there just to get a cup of coffee as it’s quite expensive. \nVerdict: 6/10 🧚', 'heres a cup of positivi-tea 🤩🥰😂 really relaxing to be drinking a warm cup of tea at a hotel high tea buffet, indeed a great way to de stress\n\nshown in pic is the colony tea and the choice of tea syrup i got was lavender 🍵', 'miss being able to casually walk and eat ice cream while shopping~ oh yes and this is the strawberry basil ice cream from birds of paradise at the jewel changi outlet! i love how they’ve a nice range of botanical gelato for you to choose from 🥰', 'how much i really want to visit a cafe so that i can sit down, relax and enjoy a cup of coffee on a sweater weather 🌧', 'Can I just say that Shake Shack is my favourite fast food restaurant in singapore and their burgers are the best I’ve eaten so far in my life! Another thing Id like to comment is that their restaurants are extremely clean. I was really blessed that my friend who was working there offered me her staff discount and it was cheaper by about half the price! Thank you friend if you’re seeing this hehe ♥️ .\n\nSHAKE STACK ($14.30)\nWow it’s just AMAZING! 🤩 When I took my first bite, it was scrumptious, you can taste the melty cheeses and the mushroom was SO juicy. They really have quality 😍👍 It’s so wonderful I’d ditch all other burgers in the world for Shake Shack’s. \nCHEESE FRIES ($5.90)\nTheir cheese is REALLLY good.\n\nLEMONADE ($4.30 for small)\nAgain, just wow. Their lemonade is so refreshing and it’s one of the best I ever drank as compared to other fast food restaurants.\n\nVerdict: 10/10 🧚', 'mini tarts are really cute']",0,,,

U pretty little thing, sooo good but so sinful 🤤😩 (yes i peeled abit off before i could get home to take a pic cos i couldn’t resist 😬)', 'sorry for the horrible pics :( but this Pork ribs noodle from Tai Seng Noodle house @ Amoy street food centre really deserves a post!!!!\n\nThe container was packed to the brim with ingredients with 2 pork ribs, 5 boiled wantons, 3 fried wantons, half a braised shroom and a big tau pok!!!! Can yall believe this was only $4??!!? Me and my mum were in disbelief and my mum kept saying maybe they charged me wrongly.. but im sure the auntie gave me the correct portion cos she told the uncle i wanted the small portion. \nOkay, enough with how generous the portion was, the pork ribs were also v flavourful and tender!!! And the wanton was also substantial in its fillings! Oh and the noodles, it remained rather springy and wasnt soggy even tho i only ate it abt 2 hrs after buying. \nAND LASTLY, the uncle and auntie were so nice, esp the uncle so jovial! Pls go support them if yall can bc there was no queue when i reached even though it was close to lunch time sobs 😢 ITS REALLY WORTH MAN i would have this every week if i lived nearer \U0001f972 and i rlly wonder if they earn from such generous portion they give..', 'Last saturday’s dinner @nipongnaepongsg \nLoved both noodles!!!! The tomato cream one was so creamy yet slightly tangy yumz and the dry one had a strong wokhey taste. \nIf only it was more affordable \U0001f972', 'First post of 2021 shall go to this icecream waffle from Gelatolabo!! \n\nTokyo mochi waffle ($6.60) + 2 gourmet icecream ($10) \nThe waffles were really good and there really was mochi within the waffle which makes me wonder how did they do it??!?? Its also crispy on the outside 🤤 \nWe got the Piemonte Hazelnut with Milk Chocolate shavings and Bronte Pistachio & Himalayan Pink Salt for our icecream. Both flavours were really creamy but the Hazelnut one stood out more! We felt that we couldnt taste the Pistachio and it was just creamy... \n\nOverall a nice icecream cafe with many interesting flavours like sakura smoke, artichoke and pear compote (it caught our eye but we didnt dare to try cos it sounded rlly exotic HAHA). Prices are also on the higher side so we may not be back anytime soon 😬🙃', '📍Veganburg \n\nCreamy shrooms burger \nI RLLY LIKED THIS ALOT and its amazing how the vegan patty taste like meat!!! And the fries omg THEY WERE SO CRISPY AND GENEROUS 🥰🥰 pls open more stores in the west/central i wanna try the other burgers 🤤', '📍Red Holic\n\nTteokbokki stew in rose sauce\nThis was so yummy!!!! I have been wanting to try this ever since i saw some accounts posting about it and I FINALLY DID YAY. Glad that it didnt disappoint, tho i never had authentic tteokbokki stew before HAHA Loved the rose sauce but felt it could be spicier!! The stew was filled with different kinds of tteokbokki eg sweet ptt and cheese!! What would make it better would be if there were more meat or veg HAHHAHA to even out the amt of carbs. \n\nWe ordered the set ($49) which came with garlic butter fries and honey chicken!! Both were pretty average, nth to shout about. \n\nOverall it was a good meal and just nice for my fam of 4 (cos we arent big eaters ahahahhah) OH and wished they had those korean side dishes instead of just pickles 😶 and my photos are so ugly sobs', '📍Le Shrimp Ramen\n\nRamen in shrimp broth w braised pork ribs ($14.50)\nOk firstly the shrimp broth is very thick!!! But not too jelat, u know those thick ramen broth that is so rich that u cant drink after a few mouths, this is not like those! Its pretty good, for someone who isnt a huge fan of prawns HAHA (why did i even choose shrimp broth right). They have tonkotsu broth too, but I heard more good reviews abt their shrimp broth so decided to give it a try. THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS WHOLE BOWL IS THE PORK RIBS omg they were so tender and so flavourful 🤤 like not soaked with the sheimp flavour but its own sauce!! Loved the ribs the most man', '📍King of Fried rice \n\nXO fried rice w pork cutlet ($7.80)\nTHIS IS REALLY DAMN YUMMY it smelt so heavenly when i first got it and i couldnt resist taking a bite 🤤 I think the rice is best when its eaten right away cos it wasn’t as good after i brought it home, but still pretty damn good!!!! Like legit can rival DTF and its cheaper!! \nTHE PORK CUTLET omg it was so juicy, tender and flavourful this one might be better than DTF eh... I WILL DEF BE BACK TO TRY THE TOMYUM FRIED RICE and trick is to go at 4+pm there was no queue at all hehe\n\nSweet potato balls & goreng pisang ($4)\nGot these from a q famous stall in Golden mile complex, its found at the entrance of the Thai supermarket!! The goreng pisang is different from the usual ones at our hawker, maybe like Thai style ahahahha The batter is not thick and i think its like some caramel nutty batter, which makes it better than our usual ones hehe cos some of those hawker ones are covered in THICCC batter which is a turnoff for me 🤨🙅🏻\u200d♀️ \n\nThe sweet ptt balls are chewy and rlly goooood!! Makes me miss taiwan sobs', 'Some new creations from this bakery/pastry shop at Clementi!!! I was so excited when i saw the yam black sesame mochi puff ($1.60) I KNEW I HAD TO TRY IT and the pastry skin was so crispy and fragrant omg. But sadly i could only taste the mochi and black sesame.. maybe the yam is not spread out evenly cos i hvent finished the whole thing HAHA BUT STILL i think its quite yumz!!!!! \nGlad to have many bakeries near me 🤤 HOPE THEY CONTINUE INNOVATING NEW BREAD AND PASTRY but also bring back the yam pastry.. they only have the yam+tausar pastry now sobs', '❗️NEW BREAD AT ROTI ❗️\n\nCrispy skin yam salted egg bread (translation for those who cant read chi 😉) $1.80\nI WAS SO EXCITED WHEN I SAW IT IM LIKE omg I HAVE TO TRY!!! so the bread has sth like a cookie crust but just abit, not like those mugiya thick thick cookie crust kind, nth special abt the crust but i guess it kinda makes the bread taste nicer than normal soft bread! \nMoving on to the fillings, the yam is similar to their usual yam filling which is goooooood. But the salted egg was not rlly my thing 😫 its like pure salted egg, like those in mooncakes, so it was too grainy for my liking but those who like salted egg can go try!! I personally feel that it might be better if the salted egg was made smoother?? But worth a try!!!!! I would still get my 6 mini yam buns YALL SHLD TRY ITS SO WORTH AND GOOD 🤤\nSry for that lousy second pic of the fillings oopsss', '📍redhill hawker\n💸 $3.50\n\nWanton mee is one of my fav hawker food and this is one of the better ones out there!! The noodles werent soggy tho i only ate it an hr later and the CHARSIEW OMG its tender and has this thin layer of fats which i think is just nice cos i dun like fatty pork HAHA and the sauce went rlly well with the charsiew too. It wasnt too sweet or salty OH and THEY GAVE ALOT OF CHARSIEW rlly worth man!!! Tho wanton only 2 but they were quite substantial in size!', 'THESE BROWNIES from @ta.ramisu ARE SO DARN GOOD OMG GAH ITS SO WORTH THE CALORIES AND MONEY (4 for $12!!) \nMy fav would be the lava cheesecake one omg the outer brownie layer was so chewy yet slightly crispy after i heated it up! And the lava cheesecake complemented the brownie rlly well! I think without the filling, it would be abit too dense? \nSecond fav is the HOUJICHA one!! The houjicha is so gao not like some filling made from cheap houjicha powder cos u can actually taste the bitterness.\nCant believe i actually forgot to take pic of the rest 😫 but its okay i will never forget how good they taste 😋', '📍Bakery Point\n\n1. Matcha Red bean bread! I could taste the matcha flavour but thought it was a tad too sweet. The bread was abit dry but the red beans added a nice chew to it! \n\n2. Maple walnut bread!! Omg i was hesitating initially whether to get this or not cos idk if the maple meant they used maple syrup and it kinda looked dry. But i was very pleasantly surprised!! The bread was filled with maple cream that tasted pretty good! Its quite unique cos i have never seen a maple cream bread before. \n\nThese breads are actually a pleasant surprise and plus point is that i got them at $1 each! Cheap trills 😋', '📍Craftsmen speciality coffee (Clarke quay)\n\nHad this q some time back and the Brioche with smoked salmon was pretty amazing!!! It came with a choice of poached eggs or scrambled eggs and we chose poached eggs. The sauce, eggs and salmon came tgt very well and it was so yummy. The bread was v soft and the portion size was huge man. \n\nOverall v yummy meal!!! And i didnt managed to try their lattes they had many interesting flavours like taro and black sesame! Gonna try their drinks the next time 🤤 \n\n#craftsmenspecialtycoffee', 'Han n han peanut pancake!!!\n\nWent all the way down just to get this and its SO GOOD!!! I bought 1 traditional and 1 crispy, both peanut flavour cos im not a fan of the rest keke. Both priced at $1 but for some more unique flavours eg black sesame, corn or cheese i think its 30 cents more! They also have mini pancakes which i didnt get. \n\nI really liked the traditional one cos THEY FILL IT WITH CRUNCHY PEANUT BUTTER, Not just grounded peanut!! I also liked that the edges were crispy and the batter wasnt too thick, mad worth cos cheaper than Granny’s pancake also!! \nThe crispy one was like a thin crispy crepe also filled w a thin layer of peanut butter! Its not bad but if u like more gao fillings then go for the traditional one!!\n\nPS theres also a tiong bahru pau a few shops away and yuhua hawker nearby AND SWEEHENG that sweeheng had so many variety if bread omggg Yuhua residents are so blessed eh 🤤😭', '📍Carrara Cafe\n\nI ordered the Salted egg fried chic and waffles ($13.90) but sad to say it wasnt impressive. The waffles were slightly crispy and fluffy but some parts turned soggy cos of the sauce, but it didnt rlly have any flavour. Good that they gave maple syrup tho! The fried chicken just tasted like those instant supermkt ones 😔 \nMy friend ordered the Tomyum seafood pasta ($13.90). The sauce was a creamy Tomyum sauce and it came with clams and prawns. I tried one mouth and it wasnt spicy at all, just sour. We also felt like the tomyum taste resembled the Nissin instant noodles seasoning HAHA \n\nOverall the food wasnt amazing but lucky for burpple 1 for 1! Might be back to try their gelato which also has 1 for 1! Oh they also have a free membership that gives a free scoop of gelato w every main!!', '📍The Coffee Academics @ Scotts Square\n\n🍝 Umami pasta \nThis dish was like a fusion pasta, kinda like spaghetti cooked with hae bi hiam and topped with a generous amt of bonito flakes!! Not bad but i think The Assembly Ground’s umami pasta is better. \n\n🌮 Crispy fish fillet tacos\nCrispy skin tacos topped with a mango sauce!! Felt that the fish was abit dry but the curly fries was rlly good!! \n\n🧁 Passionfruit cruffin (not in pic) \nThis was rlly yummy!!! I expected the filling to ooze out but it turned out to be a thick filling (lowkey abit disappointed when i cut into it) but!! It was rlly nice the outer croissant layer was so crispy and the sweet and sour filling was a nice way to end the meal heh\n\nOverall a decent meal at a rlly pretty and chill cafe but prices were on the higher side, but fortunately with burpple 1for1! Prolly wont be back if i didnt have the burpple/entertainer app tho', 'Mini muffins!! (1 for $0.60)\n\nThey looked really cute but taste pretty average la ahahahha but for its price i guess its not bad! And they have many flavours!!! I got the oreo, lemon and walnut. Swipe to third photo to see some of the flavours!! Oh they have other bread too i got the yam one but its meh the fillings were so pathetic 😭 cant compare to Roti’s yam bun only $1.20 and so generous w the filling wa loves', 'Matcha white choc strawberry mousse cake!!!!! It was pretty good and the layers were rlly pretty but i forgot to take a pic of the inside after it was cut', 'Dinner!!!!!!

Me and mama tried making yam paste its actually not that hard!! But maybe cos we didnt add too much sugar it wasnt as nice as the ones i ate outside but owells, its healthier!!', '📍Bari-uma ramen\n\nNothing beats having a yummy bowl of ramen in a shop that brings out so much of the Japan vibes when we are nowhere near 🇰🇷!! The soup is so rich and look at the charsiu!!! 🤤 Had this some time back but just gonna post this so i dont forget where are some of the good ramen places when im craving it!!', 'Lunch!!!!

216,pandan_pig,"['🧇 ANN CHIN POPIAH\n\nOne fine afternoon, I had to buy my fast-growing didi his first dinosaur phone so I stopped by Sim Lim Square. Though tbh he was just an excuse to go out of my way to try @annchinpopiah ’s WAFFLES.\n\nDon’t be fooled by this popiah stall, because it’s actually an all-in-one powerhouse. Went straight for my usual go-to PB waffle, but then spotted the Godzilla-sized fried chicken waffles on the menu for $4.90 (it’s not Yard Bird ok). Auntie said “HEN HAO CHI DE” (very nice one) and I was VERY TEMPTATED cos she was so earnest. So I got both. \n\nNo regrets, folks. Auntie happily served the waffles to me in brown open-top paper boxes, lovingly sliced into half. I hold the chunky chicken cutlet in between two halves of a waffle, still hot and crispy from the iron. The first bite is a flavour explosion: chicken juices, bbq sauce, nacho cheese, mayo, and slivers of tuckshop-tasting lettuce. They’re all wrapped up in the crispy, warm waffle sweetness that tapers off to a quasi-sogginess because the porous pancake has soaked up all the delish juices. Omg. I’m giddy with joy, oozey PB quadrant in one hand, finger-lickin-good chicken quadrant in the other, taking one bite out of each hand in turn. An intoxicating experience.\n\nTips: Go for their fillings. Give their popiahs a shot too because Ann Chin is a popiah connoisseur. I’m no expert in that realm but I LOVED it. Will be back to try the other offerings.\n\n4/5. I do prefer my waffles kueh and dense-like, but this is 100% comfort food and perfect for those of you who enjoy it light and crispy. What brings me back to Ann Chin will be the ambience and service, and the simple thrill of warm lovingly-prepared food that you get from tuckshops and canteens of old schools and army camps. The interior is orange and cheery, it wasn’t too overcrowded around 4PM, and I had a couple of other customers for quiet chatter and company. The aunties were the cutest friendliest people. They were laughing at me as I was waving the waffle around in the air and taking pictures of it right in front of them. Vibes are immaculate. Now you no longer have to go to Sim Lim to buy/sell/repair electronics, just go for Ann Chin.', '🧇 YI JIA BAKERY HOUSE CAFE\n\nI think my footage really speaks for itself in this one. A pandan waffle reimagined as an atas Belgian waffle, except served on kopitiam plastic plates and disposable cutlery. Probably the most affordable bakery cafe in town — a sit-down affair with neighbourhood bread store prices. Big plus for down-to-earth heartlander vibes. \n\nI might’ve shed some excited tears carving my plastic fork and knife through a warm bubbly pool of lip-smacking peanut butter decadence, slathered between two mochi-like waffle patties. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside (and you can definitely ask for more crispy if you swing that way). PERFECTLY BALANCED in all faculties. If you think it can’t get any better, they also sell FANTASTIC breads, some of the fluffiest doughs and most packed fillings I’ve ever eaten. \n\nHighly recommend for a go-to homely and cosy breakfast/ afternoon tea fix, with more comfortable seating than sweltering kopitiams but without the preppy-ness of cafes.\n\n4/5. It was a glorious morning. Top notch in Upper Thomson, you really don’t need Salted Caramel. Will be back for more.', '🧇 DJ BAKERY (THOMSON PLAZA)\n\nHELLO PANDAN NATION after a very long hiatus — where I took a break from social media to deal with life (don’t worry, I did not take a break from waffles) — I’M BACK and hopefully better with a little revamp that makes reviews clearer and reduces effort required from you to read my essays. Yes! The key info and stream of consciousness is now smacked onto the graphics instead!! Hooray for reinvention!!!!!! Lmk what yall think in the comments, happy to keep improving.\n\nSpotted this tastY miSteR 😩😩 from afar because the batter pot was SO GREEN. Acceptable thickness, satisfying kueh chewiness, with a cakey surface that’s pretty much like Cake History waffles if you’re familiar with those. The kosong barely tastes like anything so I’d recommend fillings — peanut butter was a solid choice that made for a satisfying breakfast paired with the usual Kopi O Kosong. \n\nOverall would say this experience was like eating peanut butter pandan Mee Jiang Kueh. A wallflower waffle that doesn’t have a single spike in any of the elements, but it does the job well enough by middling along in every aspect. Good enough to get again if I’m around.\n\n3/5.

Winning chances will be multiplied if you share this post to your story and tag more friends!\n\n🟢 PANDAN VERDICT: SHOCKINGLY GOOD LOL\n\nPlaymade has once again outdone it’s track record of incredibly flavoured pearls (we’re talking about the creators of GRAPE, BLACK SSM, KOPI ….. pearls). It’s that kind of drink where you take one sip and then you look at your friend with your eyes big big, then you nod and say “eh not bad sia you try!”\n\nON THE TEA:\n✅ Pandan taste is quite distinct and fragrant! MOST IMPORTANTLY NATURAL not like nutrisoy ondeh ondeh lmao. Would describe it as somewhat like pandan water — which is fantastic because pandan drinks can be kind of artificial and sweet. Playmade folks should be damn proud of themselves for creating a concoction that has ur typical bbt sweetness without destroying the pandan. \n✅ I’m normally 0% (no h8) but I shared this with a 25% friend and we thought the sweetness was perfect! Adjust to your taste accordingly.\n\nON THE PEARLS:\n✅ OK THIS WAS THE STAR I enjoyed the pearls most: they have their own distinct pandan flavour (I could eat a whole tub of this jeez). \n✅ the texture was top class: SO CHEWY. MY LOVE.\n\nOVERALL:\n✅ In short, pearls + drink = double pandan omg\n✅ layered nicely with milky white tea at the top and then slips in an ombre green gradient: 10/10 for chio\n\nI liked it! On the downside it’s a little pricey but DEFINITELY A MUST TRY BECAUSE IT’S SEASONAL (at least for pandan siaolang like me lah). I feel like pandan drinks are pretty polarising in general so you’ll either love it or hate it, but it was so fun to drink.

It’s a small fam biz, the only one in SG, and they’re always warm and kind to customers!! Regulars like Lia all voiced their reluctance when tHEIR CLOSURE WAS ANNOUNCED 🆘🆘🆘😣😢😭 Small neighbourhood bakeries like these are increasingly rare, esp since so many of our go-to\'s our now big chains so pls go support auntie one last time! We heard they\'re relocating to a smaller space and the current store is being taken over by another owner???? but it\'s all kind of confusing so if anyone knows better let us know \n\n✅ don’t be tricked by how it looks: I know it doesn’t look very green or impressive but the pandan flavour was so good ohmygOWF\n✅ Sides were so crispy and the kueh dense texture was on POINT. Sweetness was perfect to enjoy kosong but not cloying if paired with something. \n✅ CAN BE EATEN HOT AND COLD. You know a waffle is effing solid if it tastes good when cold.\n✅ I’m not crazy about overly thick fillings because I still want the pandan taste, so while it wasn’t BOOM GENOROSITY, the pandan and pb was cupid’s gift to us all 😫\n\n❌ I wish it were thicker but they ran out of batter SO IT’S NOT ENTIRELY THEIR FAULT. \n❌ the pb is more pasty kind - if you like oozey type I’d honestly just save cost on the pricier fillings and eat it plain. It’s damn good plain. And I think I would’ve liked the plain more.\n\n4/5. I would minus 0.25 and give it 3.75 because of cost/ thickness/ fillings but guys the taste is sOO good.

Winners will be announced the following Wednesday (23 Mar)\n\n🟢 PANDAN VERDICT: the whole dang car/ house/ kitchen smelled like pandan and Gula Melaka the moment I brought this out of the bag. INSANE.\n\nmy FIRST EVER sourdough waffles but they certainly won’t be my last!! @verygooddough takes so much pride in perfecting their art that you simply HAVE to try this. They make their own all-natural pandan extract, source the Gula Melaka direct from Melaka (it’s the real deal guys — not cloyingly sweet but in fact more savoury, and has a dark mature flavour profile like salted caramel). You know it’s a labour of love when you learn that this waffle requires fermenting the sourdough for 18-20 HOURS in the fridge to get the lovely light texture and taste. What. an. art.\n\n✅ omg the gula melaka legit chef’s kiss. THEY OOZE AND BECOME GOOEY LITTLE SWEET-SALTY CHUNKS when you heat up your waffle, which complements the not-so-sweet batter very well! Highly recommend eating this with coconut ice cream guys trust me it’s heaven.\n✅ super light and chewy insides, with crispy outsides on reheating. I’m salivating just thinking about it.\n✅ SO THICK. I’m so pleased at how massive one bite is and it really is super value for money and a fantastic family brunch idea, especially if you want to eat cafe waffles in the comfort of your home.\n\n❌ When I first tried this, @verygooddough used to cook the waffles to “eat right now” so it would get a little dry when reheating! They’ve since improved their technique to cook it to the PERFECT level so that you get to enjoy it at the optimum texture when you reheat it at home.\n\n4.2/5.

(excluding delivery)\n\n🟢 PANDAN VERDICT: Gula melaka/ lotus biscoff dominates (in a good way) so you taste that more than pandan. \n\n✅ AWESOME BITE SIZED FLAVOUR SHOTS THAT WEREN’T TOO SWEET \n✅ The texture is GOD-LEVEL😩. CRISP, CRUNCHY, BUTTERY, MELT IN MOUTH GOODNESS. The toppings were so generous — the lovely bakers rly SPAMMED it HAHA and it added an extra crunchy dimension that made these cookies so crazily addictive. It’s so hard to not reach for a second one??? \n✅ The Ondeh-Ondeh cookies boasted extra KRA-KRA from the caramelised gula melaka TOPPED WITH COCONUT FLAKES MHMHHM\n✅ Lotus Biscoff deserves an award of the year for being a king combo with pandan, and @chouubakery ‘s interpretation of it didn’t disappoint. There’s lotus spread (??) + lotus biscoff crumble scattered all over! Interestingly I found them softer and more melt-in-your mouth than the ondeh ondeh ones (not sure if deliberate)\n\n❌ This doesn’t scream PANDAN if you’re looking for super pandan-pandan flavour because the gula melaka/ biscoff overpowers the pandan. I feel like the main thing that carries this cookie is the buttery fragrance. \n\n⏺ 4/5 !!!!! In the very SG spirit of kicking out the Christmas trees and starting to play dong dong chiang in every mall, these are launched just in time for CNY and there are other cool flavours like KOPI AND PECAN (!!!) and Butterscotch.

As we round up this series I learned how waffle-populated the purple line is cos the red line only has Cake History for like half the line LOL. This time I tried all the new fillings that they had on display: Japanese cream cheese, gula melaka coconut and caramel. Just to taste test if they’re worth paying more or if you should just stick to the classics!\n\n🟢 PANDAN VERDICT: I really should’ve gotten plain because I tasted nothing except fillings. \n\n✅ LOOK at how ginormous the kueh-like centre is when you bite into it. If you like your waffles soft, chewy, and floppy, this ticks all the boxes. \n✅ The “special flavours” are only $1.80 to $2 and plain is $1.30. The first one with plain under $1.40 in a while!! And it’s halal!\n✅ The fillings were SO GAO omg. It’s like the auntie spammed the whole buckets of fillings onto it. I bit into the cream cheese and it literally exploded from the other side (see pic). I appreciated the gula melaka coconut the most cos the coconutty bits provided texture variation + sweet/ saltiness that wasn’t too OP. I PITCH THAT WE SHOULD MAKE COCONUT A THING.\n\nBut this waffle had some issues that kind of made it hard to love even though I wanted to love it so badly ))):\n\n❌ I prefer my waffles to have kueh-like insides and crispy outsides, but this didn’t really have a legit crust and so the texture was a let-down. \n❌ While you really get a good deal with how much filling goes into, it was way too much. Everything was jelak after three bites and it didn’t help that the texture was also very uniformly chewy. Caramel was a massive no because it really didn’t taste like caramel (just super diabetic).\n\n⏺ 3/5. This has all the makings of a potentially End Game waffle but idk man I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED. I might give it a try again, with these added tips that I suggest you use when you visit this place: ✅ask for less fillings, ✅ask for a crispier waffle, ✅stick to the normal fillings/ plain\n\nWon’t Come Back\nGood for a One-Time Try ⬅️\nCan Come Back\nChanged my Life', '<2/3> PURPLE LINE SERIES\n\n🧇 MUGIYA\n📍City Square Mall, #B1-235 (Farrer Park MRT)\n⏰ 7AM - 11PM\n\nToday we go —> TOWARDS HARBOURFRONT and <— back to when @lia_deats belanja me this Mugiya waffle from City Square Mall at Farrer Park MRT. Idk about you but I was 2021-years old when I found out Farrer Park was on the NEL — I literally thought it was yellow for MY WHOLE LIFE cos I kept thinking it was Farrer Road. \n\n🟢 PANDAN VERDICT: it’s fragrant and eggy more so than pandan-ey! I RLY THINK that the batter might be the same as Cake History sia like they’re very similar and also use the same posters??\n\n✅ Thick and substantial. Like this waffle must be at least a pound omg she’s so heavy. Every bite is a pretty intense jaw workout (like you have to do the AH---M *open mouth big to eat* motion) so you get a lot of batter for your buck!!!\n✅ Noice eggy coconut fragrance with light pandan undertones! Good amount of sweetness that makes this a nice waffle to enjoy plain without having to shell out the extra on the fillings (which are more ex)\n✅ The outsides are more cake-like and chewy than crispy/crunchy, with soft, moist and kueh like insides\n\n❌ The problem with Mugiya waffles imo (and actually any waffle that is cakier, like Prima Deli or Cake History, or those that lean into the cake spectrum) are that they dry out super fast. They’re best eaten fresh, or not more than half an hour after purchase. When I ate the mugiya at home it was really stodgy and the outer crust was v dry and tough to chew. \n❌ More a floppy waffle! It hold its structure tho (see video)\n\n⏺ 3.5/5. The best part about this waffle was the thickness: it was enough to not be jelak but to satisfy your hungry waffle-wolfing belly. I did wish it was less airy tho. I RLY NEED TO WORK HARDER AT FINDING PURPLE WAFFLE THAT INCH OVER THE 4.0 MARK LOL —\xa0the whole line is filled with decent waffles that are awesome to have on a regular basis if you live nearby (I would get Mugiya everyday if I lived/ worked around!), but not game changer! This one was made sweeter and more nostalgic bc @lia_deats got it though —\xa0thank you fellow waffle pal \n\nWon’t Come Back\nGood for a One-Time Try\nCan Come Back ⬅️\nChanged my Life', '<1/3> PURPLE LINE SERIES\n\n🧇 QBREAD\n📍102 Towner Road, #01-244 (Outside Boon Keng MRT)\n⏰ 6AM - 10.30PM\n\nPart of this pandan pig dream involves one day mapping the whole island with waffles — but more than that, mapping the WHOLE SMRT MAP WITH WAFFLES. I’m currently in the midst of creating a Waffle MRT Trail so here we go with the first of the PURPLE LINE.\n\n🟢 PANDAN VERDICT: the smell was damn strong when we walked out of the MRT (take Exit A don’t take Exit B, I was wrong so I had to walk back \U0001f972) Just follow the smell. HOWEVER, when it came down it taste, it honestly didn’t taste very much like pandan (kind of just … generically sweet and tasty)\n\n✅ Very crispy. It’s the ham chim peng/ butterfly bun kind of crispy crunches and crackles as you bite into it, and encases a gooey, chewy kueh-like centre that’s still a little soft when enjoyed hot.\n✅ Sweetness was perfect for a plain waffle. Had it plain this time so I can’t comment on the fillings, but damn it was a good plain waffle.\n✅ Price is pretty average, not crazily expensive but also not crazily cheap. Just RIGHT OUTSIDE the MRT (but there again every waffle in this series is going to be right outside the MRT LOL)\n✅ Still awesome when reheated. I kept half and toasted it and it was good to go.\n\n❌ The auntie probably gave me some leftover waffle that nobody wanted which was kind of like … NOOOO … but to my surprise it was still pretty hot and I nearly scalded my fingers taking this pic so … ok lah close one eye\n❌ thickness is eh\n❌ I’m not too crazy about the service at this place, like the auntie didn’t say a word throughout the entire process LMAO but she also wasn’t mean (despite the terrible reviews online). Overall a no-frills, no-words transactional waffle exchange, though it seems like quality is pretty variable.\n\n⏺ 3.5/5. Will satisfy cravings, and will come back if I’m passing by Boon Keng — objectively a decent waffle for yall purple liners. \n\nWon’t Come Back\nGood for a One-Time Try\nWill Come Back ⬅️\nChanged my Life', '🥥CRESC BITES\n📍Shopee/Lazada\n\nI 💚 pandan & I 💚 coconut.

They make other 🌱 snacks like plain ol’ Original Coconut Chips and Sweet Potato Chips. AND IT’S FOR ALL TO ENJOY because it’s (1) HALAL, (2) VEGAN, (3) GLUTEN-FREE, and DAMN HEALTHY.\n\n🟢 PANDAN VERDICT: I love these. They’re so fragrant. But they rly didn’t taste very much like pandan. They’re just sweeter than the OG flavour!\n\n✅ SOOO ASMR crunchy — just look at the video!!##$@!! These were toasted to perfection. I’ve tried heck loads of coconut snacks and some of them rly taste like sawdust: even after your jaw has gotten a death workout, the coconut bits are still stuck there. NOT THIS. They’re super light and brittle flakes that crackle and yield as soon as you put them between your teeth. A texture triumph - 10/10. \n✅ We couldn’t stop snacking. Light + addictive, but you don’t feel like you’re ingesting buckets of salt/ sugar/ oil. Just clean and simple, kind to your throat\n✅ Kind of tastes like love letters??\n\n❌ My fam thought the original coconut was the best! We’d get that one again. The pandan version is nice, but doesn’t entirely deliver what it aims to do. it’s rly damn hard to get the pandan flavour infused into snacks like these - I haven’t found a single successful one \U0001f972\n❌ I think it’s fairly priced for the quality, but my dad did want more chips and less air in the bag though LOL (and he’s right)\n\n⏺ 3.5/5.

Winners will be announced next Sunday (12 Dec).\n\n🟢 PANDAN VERDICT: not a pandan waffle, but A DAMN GOOD WAFFLE\n\nWe all know what makes our waffles sweaty and droopy ☹️: not eating it fresh. I’ve always wished someone would make waffles that taste good long to survive a car ride or till breakfast tomorrow, and: SOMEONE DID. \n\n@thepanobakehouse developed a recipe and technique that allows you to enjoy these fresh-made-daily waffles ANY TIME. It tastes good whether at room temp or reheated (how?? does this magic work??). They’re also selling frozen plain waffles which you can reheat and it works like a charm - all I had to do was pop it into the air fryer/toaster!\n\n✅ These 8️⃣ little chewy kueh-like waffle wedges pack enough flavour to rival Bakery Cuisine/ Triplets, and I daresay even beats them on taste.\n✅ Perfect sweetness, complemented with the right amount of generously slathered fillings with hints of vanilla milkiness. Every bite was SO dense and oomph\n✅ If you’re incapable of decisions, this is for you. You get EIGHT FLAVOURS. The jams were such premium quality (fruit bits!!), chocolate and pb soO rich, LOTUS BISCOFF even came with a crumbly crackle Lotus Biscoff CRUNCH version ⁉️ I think it’s rly fairly priced ($5.80/box, $8.70/ 1L milk tea), and a great sharing box too!\n✅ Yall — the milk tea is manna and golden rain from heaven. \n\n❌ The only quibble I have is that the surface can be somewhat oily to eat/hold because it helps the waffle get crispy if reheated! \n\n4.5/5. This is actually revolutionary. @thepanobakehouse kept asking me for feedback to improve and I was useless cos I said I couldn’t fault anything.

Going at $20.80 (my wallet rly pokai from eating these cakes sia) — the price is owed to the premium quality fine Japanese flour and sugar.\n\n🟢 PANDAN VERDICT: very mild and subtle, but very natural! More herbaceous and gentle as opposed to the bombastic gao Gao Bengawan Solo taste\n\n✅ This cake in a word: extra fine, extra light. If it had a personality, it’ll be posh powdered lady vibes. Designed to float like a feather and feel like nothing on your tongue, and all that spamming of Japanese poof-poof ingredients do what they’re meant to do. \n✅ Marvellously uniform texture throughout, with minimal lobangs. It kinda feels like a mattress sponge (LMAO I KNOW THIS SOUNDS UNAPPETISING BUT IT IS) \n✅ politely sweet, It tastes very distinct from other pandan cakes I’ve tried, and I can’t place it. I feel like its almost milky which is unique! \n\n❌ In exchange for lightness, you don’t really get density or substance. I felt like this was the driest on the tongue and throat.\n❌ It wasn’t the most memorable cake. I already forgot how it tasted. This was from my notes right after I ate it LOL\n\n⏺ 3.5/5. Idk if my taste palate is country bumpkin or peasant or what (which could totally be the case and I apologise) but I thought it was so-so! I’ve heard friends REALLLY rave about this though. Would recommend as a gift/potluck contribution because the box is nice and the cake comes in a plastic wrapping and all, but I doubt it’ll wow the crowd (at least it didn’t wow me).\n\nSummary: Dulcet & Studio is the most value for money and I crown it champion of this 3-part atas pandan cake series. I think I have an UNSOPHISTICATED PALATE LMAO but I promise it’s honest - these are all excellent cakes and I rly admire the thought that creators put into making the best Pandan Cake^TM (i only know how to eat dk how to make!!), but it boils down to whether the $ is worth it for the average pocket!\n\nWon’t Come Back ⬅️\nGood for a One-Time Try\nWill Come Back \nChanged my Life', '🍰 CHENG’s @ 27\n📍27 Yong Siak Street, S168654.\n⏰ 10AM - 3PM, 5.30-9PM (Closed on Tues), order online!\n\nThis is touted by 8 Days as “the best store-bought pandan chiffon cake in town” which is a huge claim over my bakery aunties, so while I don’t claim to be a sophisticated magazine food critic at all, here’s my take on Cheng’s @ 27. \n\n🟢 PANDAN VERDICT: Gula Melaka dominates Pandan in this cake’s flavour profile, so you definitely taste the thick caramel-y taste over a very subtle and sophisticated pandan scent. \n\n✅ Cheng’s distinguishes itself over its competitors with premium quality ingredients, and just talking to the owner, we could see that they lots of pride in the love, care and purpose that they put into making this Pandan Gula Melaka cake: think organic coconut oil and *cold-pressed pandan juice* that doesn’t skimp on quality or effort!!! \n✅ This cake was HUGE. And I mean MASSIVE. Like it was TWO CAKES stacked on top of one another. It’s basically the Raffles Place Bakery Cuisine of chiffon cakes so you really do get a sizeable quantity for the price you pay.\n✅ The insides. Omg. Super moist and speckled with Gula Melaka pockets that pack a l punch every time you find one. \n✅ The cake itself is rly low in sugar, so it barely tastes sweet — very healthy but not for sweet tooths \n✅ If you are going to get the cake, you MUST get the kaya. It’s $15 alone but just $10 with the cake, and it is what makes this cake different. Without it, I think it’s quite normal.\n\n❌ This definitely is way too costly to be your daily breakfast fix. I struggled to find the wow factor in the chiffon cake itself that warranted paying $40 for it. It was indeed super premium ingredients and I enjoyed it, but there are defo satisfactory lower cost options\n❌ the insides were DAMN moist but the outer surface a little dryer!\n\n⏺ 4.2/5. I’m honestly wowed by the care that the creators of this gargantuan cake put into their work and I legit was damn stunned and floored when I ate the cake-kaya combo. But it has a steep price tag and has to be enjoyed with the kaya for it to rly change your life. \n\nWon’t Come Back\nGood for a One-Time Try ⬅️\nWill Come Back \nChanged my Life', '<1/3 PANDAN CHIFFON CAKE SERIES>\n\n🍰 DULCET & STUDIO\n📍Takashimaya #B2-33, also at Bukit Merah Connection One!\n⏰ 8AM - 7PM\n\nY’all requested for a pandan cake series on my poll and so HERE WE ARE. I am so excited for this week of reviews because if Singapore had a national cake, it is THE pandan chiffon cake. Like there’s no question about it. It took me a long time to get to pandan cake reviews bc I don’t normally “review” them, I guzzle them like water — and no one reviews water. The weekly pandan waffle rituals at the neighbourhood bakeries are always accompanied by buying a pandan cake from the same store. I’m used to the neighbourhood bakery taste and I’m really not fussy about my cakes, but for this series I’m going ~out of my way~ to see if those specialty stores that market themselves as superior to my waffle auntie’s pandan cakes are rly worth the extra buck.\n\n🟢 PANDAN VERDICT: I am a convert. This is insane. Pandan Cakes normally just taste sweet but this tasted like PANDAN. LIKE GOT THE HERBY LEAFY TASTE. My father came out of the room like “girl what’s that smell??”\n\n✅ The pandan amazes you first, and then the moistness of this just shakes you to your core. It’s crazy how it melts in your mouth and almost washes down your throat like mee sua. If you chill the cake (PLEASE DO), it’s almost mousse-like and leaves a cool icy kiss on your tongue. My father disapproved of every other pandan cake he ate as “tough to swallow” after this life-changing experience.\n✅ Sweetness was just right. It wasn’t jelak at all. I could eat the whole damn 15cm of cake myself.\n✅ So soft that your fingers WILL leave ugly disfiguring indents on it.\n✅ You have to pay $7 for just 15cm of cake (which is the small size), making it more expensive than my neighbourhood auntie’s, but I promise you that it’s worth. every. dollar. Don’t pay $20 for some artisanal one. This one literally takes the cake.\n\n❌ I have no criticisms apart from wishing it was bigger. I also don’t think it’s halal unfortunately ): do correct me if it is!\n\n⏺ 5/5. Full marks. Nuff said.

Lightly fried golden brown and crispy on the outside, with an insanely soft and fluffy inside that sits nicely in between the kueh-cake spectrum like a very moist and dense sponge-cake. This is the kind that will make you SO HAPPY AND WARM INSIDE when you eat it PIPING HOT. I stress. HOT. EAT IMMEDIATELY. \n✅ Sweetness was just nice, not too sweet. The waffle is very light on the palate, which makes it not jelak. They seem v proud of having no additives!

EACH ingredient (even the blueberries) worked perfectly tgt \U0001fad0🥗😍\n\ndefinitely smth i would describe as a light yet flavourful meal ~ light as in it doesn’t have too strong of a taste (i mean its a salad so obv.) not light in the sense of not filling, bc boy this portion was def shareable for 2!!!!! \n\nPS: if youre wondering abt the coffee, its p okay too:))) altho Apartment Coffee will always have my heart;) anyways defos worth a try if you’re around the area. -S', 'i had a crazy insane pancake craving all week so i was so ready to inhale these into my system!! 🤤🤤🤤\n\nmy friend and i got the matcha millefeuille panckes, 4 pieces for $8.90 + we got vanilla ice cream for $1!!! vv reasonable imo, i’ve seen so many other pancake places that charge way more\U0001f972 but i will say if youre looking for A* pancakes this isn’t the place, it’s definitely a little more homemade vibe here, so with in that in mind, the pancakes #slap. \n\ni love love love this little cafe, it gives off tiny ulu diner vibes while still being so easily accessible, right next to/outside bugis junction! i also LOVE how each table has its own syrup glass dispenser thing 😍😍unlike some other places that give you a tiny little cup of syrup that comes with your order and is never enough 😐\n\nthe texture leans toward the soufflé type pancakes and were really airy and light! i usually prefer those dense hotcake type flapjacks but i really enjoyed these bc they didn’t have a crazy eggy taste, which is a huge plus 🥰 my only grumble is that they didn’t have all that much of a matcha taste to it; i still enjoyed every gobble tho❣️\n\nwill def return! cheap cheap good good 🙌🏾 do take note they close around 8pm? i didn’t know, so we kinda had to yeet outta there quick, but other than that service is real sweet too ❤️🥞\n\nnaoMElovepancakes', 'M&S cafe!! \nwas quite shookt at how good the food is here!! it wasn’t too expensive either! i got their bagel w salmon and cream cheese and it came deconstructed but that’s ok bc i had fun putting it tgt, but i reckon if i was crazy starving i would’ve been annoyed having it not look like the pictures and having to put it tgt \U0001f972\n\nother than that 10/10! idk if its the sunday morning after church brunch vibe that made me really enjoy this meal or maybe it was the company 😚😚😚 \n\nthe pancakes are really good too, but the berries are really intense and sometimes abit too sour! but they taste fresh & juicy so if you’re into berries you would love them❣️\n\nnaomi jj girl bean', 'it may not look it, but this was the best mala i ever had 😭 i had this at this cute, perfectly little store in city hall and it SHUT DOWN 😭 i only had it once and it was my virgin mala experience, never to be had again LITERALLY 😔😔\n\nwe didn’t get it spicy enough when i went, i shall not name who turned red while eating this 🤭🤭but shoutout to my cutiepie bestie who brought me to this gem!! \n\nxx n40m1', 'this place gives me real mixed feelings because the things here are really hit, semi-hit, or err big miss\n\ncarbonara ($18) and wagyu beef bowl ($20) semi-hit? i think it’s just not your traditional carbonara, gets you jelak fast, but it’s not bad, just tastes a little different than what i’m used to for carbonara. the beef bowl was good, tasted fine but it was nothing spectacular for 20 bucks, you could honestly get better beef bowls for cheaper somewhere else :>>> (yoshinoya 4ever uwu❣️)\n\nnow the bacon benedict and vegetarians benny were $16 each and were a miss \U0001f972\U0001f972\U0001f972 the benedicts are tiny irl but that’s fine i’ll shut up bc it’s not like i eat alot BUT my god there were these WET greens on the muffins which they called sautéed greens but it just tasted like soggy???

All of the meat were juicy and tender 😍 my only gripe is that it was on the pricier side, at 18 pieces for $45++ and some of the pieces were awfully tiny 😬', '\u2063\nDipping Ramen (Cold/ Hot Noodles)\u2063\n📍Ramen Bar Suzuki│Raffles Place\u2063\n\u2063\nI came here in search for tsukemen but the broth that came with it wasnt thick at all 😢. It was similar to normal ramen soup, on the thinner side. The noodles came with an option of having it hot or cold. The hot option made it too hot when having it together with the dipping soup 😬 but the cold noodles had a yuzu taste which was very refreshing 😋. Other than tsukemen, they have many flavours of ramen which seems interesting.

It just wasnt as creamy or cloying as carbonara is, which makes it a good choice for people who cant take creamy dishes ☺️ the dish was pretty good, but it wasnt excellent and nothing stood out from it. It is still a good dish to go for when you're undecided or have nothing to eat 💯\u2063\n\u2063\nthe gnocchi was too salty 😖 but i actually prefer it over the boscaiola because the chewy texture added so much more to the dish than the normal spaghetti that came with the boscaiola.

I finished every last drop of the soup!!!! \u2063\nthe fish head was piled up high to form a tower which made it pretty hard to eat the noodles, unless you finish most of the fish head first haha. There wasnt a lot of meat in the fish head but any present were oh so tender and fill of collagen 🥺 which made it so smooth 🤤\u2063\nThe noodles were too cooked for me and could have had more bite to it but the soup was really the best thing out of this bowl.\u2063\nI might die without having this for a year when i leave 😭\u2063', '\u2063\n1.

However, this particular pasta changed my mind.\nStanding at $26, this tagliatelle was the embodiment of perfection. Every mouth consisted of perfectly cooked pasta with a spring in each bite. I simply could not get enough. For the first time in a long time, the star of the show was truly the tagliatelle, not the sauce nor the meat - which faded into the background. Hell, if heaven was a thing, i would still pay for it. \nMoral of the story: I’m simply a carbs person. 🤷🏻\u200d♀️\n~~~ \nHonorable mentions:\n- Burrata was good & when eaten with the olive oil, a pinch of vinaigrette and nutty rocket, it was simply 👩\u200d🍳💋. \n- Their grilled lamb was really good too. Not gamy and the meat simply glides off the bone. \n- While the chocolate lava cake initially disappointed me with the ooze (or lack thereof), it made up for it with the taste. The charred and slightly bitter cake complemented the sweet vanilla ice cream really well.', '@apiary.sg ice cream is so smooth and criminal that i went twice in one month. \n~~\nFirst time, i got their bailey’s & brownies ($4.70) flavor. There were a fair bit of chunky (just how i like it) brownies and i could definitely taste the bailey though not that strong, but I ain’t complaining. Did found the portion quite small could be probably cos i was hungry haha. \n~~\nSecond time, i tried their lavender ($4.20) and mugi cha (roasted barley tea ~ $4.70 cos premium) with waffles. This time round, the 2 scoops of ice cream were enough for 3. Maybe the takeaway cup too small 🤔 \nHonestly the ice cream outshone the waffles in every way. The taste of lavender was really prominent and i could smell the roastedness of the barley even before i bit into it. Soo good. The only downside for me were the waffles that i found a little too “dry” for my liking, esp towards the end.\n~~\nNonetheless, would most definitely go back to try the rest of their flavors!', 'Tried Havla for the first time and overall everything were pretty good. \nGenmaicha latte ($5.80) was by far the most enjoyable and i would most definitely order again.

The sweet harmony of each roasted crunchy rice grains and pleasantly bitter matcha almost had me ordering a second one. But i am a grown ass woman with self control.

Pretty sure i tried “drinking” with it for at least 5 times before learning my lesson 🤦🏻\u200d♀️🤦🏻\u200d♀️\nFor the goma cake ($7.80), honestly it is a pretty good cake just that i much prefer my black sesame in things like tang yuan cos i found the cake a tad too creamy and lacking of texture.\nFeeling slightly adventurous, i also ordered the matcha soba gelato (ard $5+ can’t remember for sure). Sadly not a big fan of this as i felt the soba gave it an odd sweetness and the soba pieces just tasted like soggy noodles in ice cream.\nSide note, their decor reminds me of a sauna with the pebbles.

We got the 80% dark chocolate ice-cream which was pleasantly sweet and went really well with the bitter 88% sauce. A definite MUST get for dark chocolate lovers - a perfect mix of crunchy, sweet and bitter. The answer to your chocolate cravings. Gosh i wanna taste it all over again... \n~~\nChocolate banana Graham ($9.50) graham crumbs, banana, 66% dark chocolate sauce. The ice cream we got for this set was the Genmaicha - roasted rice tea. So. Damn. Good. Period. I could taste the sweet nutty aroma of roasted rice alongside a slight bitterness from the matcha and it’s great to have the actual rice grains along with tea leaves giving some texture to this ice-cream. Honestly i would just have this ice-cream alone just so i can savor it without any other distracting elements. \n~~\nWith #burpplebeyond there’s 1-for-1 so 2 sets for $9.50!! 10/10 would return again.', 'Finally got around to trying Shake Shack. I actually tried it before in Seoul but it was unmemorable. Glad that the one in SG is better. \n~~\nFor the burger i got their SmokeShack ($10.90) and overall it was a decent albeit rather spicy burger - sauce overpowered the patty for me. The bun was good but denser than how i would like it amd not as crispy so as i got towards the end of the bun-soaked sauce, it reminded me of a french toast opps. \n~~\nCheese fries ($5.90) was really quite delicious though for a cheese lover for me the sauce was not as cheesy but rather more creamy. Other than that, everything else was good. \n~~ \nGood thing i ordered the chocolate milkshake ($6.90) as it helped tamed the fire in my mouth from the burger (okay i weak 💁🏻\u200d♀️). On a whole, the milkshake was creamy asf and not gelat if shared between 2 people. \n~~\nOverall, Shake Shack was a pretty enjoyable meal and i may just go back and try the rest of their food if the queue was shorter.', 'HAPPY CHOCOLATE DAY FRIENDS!! Here are some super fudgyyyy brownies i baked awhile back.

Blend them all till smooth. \n- Mix in chocolate chips. No amt is too little 😜 \n- Bake in preheated oven 176°C for ard 20 mins \nIn hindsight, I would not have added so much pb as i personally found the pb to be too strong and had a lingering nutty taste.

Really sad to hear that tomorrow would be their last day! 🙁 \nEverything about the “Nasi Lemak” dessert ($14.90) was created with thoughtfulness and creativity. From the slightly sweet and spicy “sambal chilli” which could have easily resembled the real thing, to their acidic “egg yolk” sorbet that complemented beautifully with the pandan mouuse which was covered with coconut. This dessert was the highlight of my day and it certainly did not hurt that it was gorgeous to look at 👀 \nHowever, their “Roasted Oolong Pear” ($13.90) fell a little short for me. Although the pear was roasted quite well, the ice cream at the bottom was no longer as cold - probably from the pear directly on the top. This then hampered the wonderful contrast of cold vs hot that i was looking forward to. Taste wise, there was nothing very spectacular about chocolate in pear with ice-cream. \nThe last dessert I tried was the “Chocolate Avalanche” ($13.90). It was really good with the chocolate lava cake truly molten and devilishly chocolate-ty.

Nutty, with crisp hazelnut crumbs that added the additional crunch factor, this was very addictive. \n\n𝐁𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐲’𝐬 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞\nOur favorite! We loved the distinct alcoholic taste from the Bailey’s in the rich chocolate ganache, but of course we wouldn’t complain if more Bailey’s was used😛 \n\n𝐄𝐚𝐫𝐥 𝐆𝐫𝐞𝐲 𝐌𝐢𝐥𝐤 𝐂𝐡𝐨𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞\nOur other favorite! There were very distinct floral bergamot notes from the earl grey, and we loved how the feuilletine crunch added that addictive crunch factor. Although this was milk choc, it wasn’t overly sweet and we loved how creamy and luscious this was.\n\n𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐂𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐢𝐞-𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐩𝐢𝐫𝐞𝐝\nChocolate swirled with butterscotch ganache, potato chips, salted pretzel crumbs and edible compost cookie-inspired cookie dough, this was frankly our least favorite flavor out of the lot.

Here’s what we ordered: \n\n𝐓𝐨𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐢 𝐌𝐚𝐤𝐢 𝐑𝐨𝐥𝐥 \nCrisp and beautifully charred, this not only closely resembled the real unagi, but tasted like it too. Tender and chewy with a slight ‘fishy’ taste, and generously topped with teriyaki sauce and mayonnaise, this was amazing and we couldn’t believe it was vegan. In fact, we found ourselves enjoying this even more than the real unagi maki...for this was boneless (🤭) and tasted just like the real deal! \n\n𝐒𝐡𝐢𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐞𝐬𝐞\nAnother dish that we couldn’t get enough of. Encased in a layer of crisp fried batter that resembled tempura, the fried shiitake mushrooms were crisp at the edges yet tender and chewy on the inside. Topped with a layer of melted cheese and chili sauce, this was just so addictive. \n\n𝐓𝐨𝐟𝐮𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐢 𝐃𝐨𝐧 \nSimilar to the Tofunagi maki, but in donburi style, this also closely resembled the real unagi don. However, perhaps because the tofunagi portion was larger, it got rather cloying towards the end and the tofu/soy taste came through quite prominently after a while. We would prefer the Maki to this! \n\n𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐝 𝐁𝐫𝐞𝐰 𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞\nA pretty decent bottle of white cold brew - it was sufficiently smooth, milky and creamy, and would likely appeal to those who love milky lattes. But as hardcore coffee lovers, we would definitely have preferred it to be more robust in flavor! \n\nIf you’re into vegan food or are looking for healthier options, do give Lucky Cat Cafe a try! 😍\n\n🌟TBG traffic light Rating: \n💚(Must try)✔️ #tbgbests \n💛(Can try) \n❤️ (Don’t try) \n\n💰TBG Broke scale:\n💸(value for money)\n💸💸(not cheap) ✔️ (~$55 total) \n💸💸💸(broke!)', '🍚Eat 3 Bowls🍚\n📍Pasir Panjang \n\nThere’s nothing quite like having a warm, comforting bowl of Taiwanese braised pork rice during this rainy season.

These fluffy round things were also surprisingly rather light on the palate. And the best part? They were oozing with generous servings of thick, luscious creamy fillings. As hardcore tea lovers, we were completely sold by the distinct roasted green tea taste in the hojicha filling of the hojicha donut. The smoky flavors of the hojicha were well-balanced by the sweet milky flavors of the cream filling, making this a decadent treat that would satisfy any tea lover. We also really enjoyed the vanilla bean donut which was filled with a generous serving of rich, milky creamy vanilla bean custard.

Arabica sure ticked all the right boxes. Their oat latte was not only nutty, creamy, and smooth, with hints of caramel and chocolate, but was also robust, balanced and aromatic - evidence of the premium quality coffee beans used here. It was unlike any other coffee we’ve ever tried, and every sip left us wanting more.']",0,,,

223,tianscrumbs,"['breadyard!! \n\ni absolutely love this place💕, it is clean and simple and i adore the rustic poetry they use for coffee/tea! \n\nthe star of the show was definitely the prawn bacon aglio olio. the surprising part was that the aroma of prawn and bacon infused into the pasta noodles. usually with aglio olio, what shines is the garlic as it should as it is aglio olio but this was a pleasant surprise and was seriously addictive (tho some prawn were not v fresh 🤷🏻\u200d♀️)\n\nthe chocolate crossiant, moderately sweet chocolate to compliment the buttery exterior, not the best but definitely good enough to curb a craving\n\nthe big breakfast was pretty standard imo. i hope you give this place a try and some dishes which i’ve tried but didn’t order that day are the pulled pork eggs benedict and chicken shawarma, my loves', 'ny verden - SPEECHLESS \n\nthis is the kind of place i don’t like to review for the sole reason that i cannot describe the delicacies intricately enough to do any of it justice but i really want to share and promote this place so i’ll do my best!! \n\n𝙗𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙙 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙙𝙞𝙥 was simple and the hummus with a little spicy kick was a pleasant starter \n\n𝙜𝙪𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙚 was actually a gnocchi dish with a scrumptiously crispy exterior with chewy soft interior. the sauce was absolutely to die for, creamy but not in a surfeiting way, clean and making you wanting more. love the added texture profile from the baby corn \n\ngot to say it was an awfully small portion but i was astounded by this dish. 𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙘𝙠𝙚𝙣 𝙘𝙤𝙦𝙪𝙚𝙡𝙚𝙩, the combination of the mustard leaf purée, summer truffle and perfectly cooked piece of chicken was a work of art \n\n𝙜𝙧𝙞𝙡𝙡𝙚𝙙 𝙩𝙞𝙜𝙚𝙧 𝙥𝙧𝙖𝙬𝙣, the succulent meat with the saltiness of the capers was a refreshing blend that i loved \n\nfinally the BEST dish, probably of my life (just above anything my mum cooks) is the 𝙗𝙡𝙖𝙘𝙠 𝙘𝙤𝙙. the first bite, i got all components in one and i truly have never been this impressed by a fish dish, or any dish in fact. the pil pil sauce was addictive, cod was so silky, and to contrast the silkiness of the fish, the starchy cassava was perfect, a masterpiece to say the least. \n\npersonally didn’t really try 𝙞𝙨𝙖𝙥𝙝𝙖𝙣 which was the dessert but my sister absolutely fell in love with it\n\nny verden is located in Jewel at a more quiet portion of the huge mall so please, i’m telling you, go and have a go yourself, you won’t regret it 😉', 'i am literally still eating this rn but i have to do this now bc i am in utter bliss \n\nʙʀᴏᴡɴɪᴇ ᴡɪᴛʜ ᴘᴇᴀɴᴜᴛ ʙᴜᴛᴛᴇʀ ᴄʀᴜᴍʙʟᴇ ɪᴄᴇ ᴄʀᴇᴀᴍ ($8.90) the price!! the brownie is crispy on the outside and gooey and decadent in the middle. the bittersweet chocolate blends with the peanut butter flavour to form a great rendition of this all time favourite combination. not too overpowering, nicely balanced dessert\n\nʜᴏᴊɪᴄʜᴀ ɪᴄᴇ ᴄʀᴇᴀᴍ ($3.90) i love the texture and for the price you are really getting a bang for your buck. the roasted tea flavour is also strong but again not overdoing it. \n\ni am seriously here with my family, swaying to song covers and i just am feeling v content and happy💕 this place is def worth trying 🥰', 'pt 2 for brotherbird and i have to say, i love itt \n\nthe eggs benedict used a brioche bread which made it softer and easier to eat. my only qualm is the ham, they gave a generous amount but i find that it upped the saltiness by quite a bit but overall not a bad dish \n\n the mochi donut was honestly one of the best desserts i’ve tried, the donut was warm, soft and chewy! the combination of the soft fried dough and creamy ice cream was seriously TO DIE FOR. i was so surprised by it and you cannot see but in the little donut hole is some granola that added a nice crunch. if you know me you’ll know i don’t like matcha but the soft serve was not too overpowering so i still enjoyed it! was really sad that i was so full to fully enjoy her 😭', 'ahh brotherbird😍 tried the may lineup and i love it\n\ntaro mochi was definitely my favourite, natural taro paste with the chewy mochi, it was not too sweet ah i downed this one\n\nthe earl grey crossiant had a strong roasted tea taste, it was really good \n\nthe pain au chocolat was pretty standard imo! \n\nreally happy with the flavours i got def worth going down and giving these a shot this month🥰', 'ps cafe\n\nfinally got to try this highly raved cafe and i have to say i’m def coming back soon 🤩 \n\ni fell in love with 𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙘𝙠𝙚𝙣 𝙧𝙤𝙨𝙨𝙖 𝙥𝙖𝙨𝙩𝙖, the penne was al dente, perfect chewy bite with the creamy yet tangy cream tomato sauce. and i rarely see just chicken used as a protein in pastas and i love it! been meaning to get a good pasta dish and this really was a winner🤩\n\nas for the 𝙨𝙝𝙤𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙧𝙪𝙛𝙛𝙡𝙚 𝙛𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙨, these were pretty disappointing, the fries was fried nicely but the truffle aroma was really lacking, as it was just grated on top, not much of the smell came through \n\nmy sister had the chicken special and she said it was amazing too, so overall it was a really good meal and i think one of my fav cafes from now on! 🤩', 'oo italian osteria \n\nthe lighting at my seat definitely made these shots 🤩\n\nthe 𝙧𝙞𝙨𝙤𝙩𝙩𝙤 was the most impressive dish in my opinion, the creaminess of the cheese was contrasted well with the sweet wine reduction thus making the dish a lot easier to finish and with the added hazelnuts nuts for a little bit of texture and flavour it was truly a well put together dish. \n\nthe 𝙗𝙖𝙠𝙚𝙙 𝙡𝙖𝙜𝙨𝙖𝙣𝙖 ‘𝙜𝙧𝙖𝙣𝙙𝙢𝙖’ 𝙨𝙩𝙮𝙡𝙚 was like every typical lagsana, however i felt that there was quite a bit of pasta slices which made it pretty carby \n\nthe 𝙩𝙧𝙖𝙙𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙖𝙡 𝙨𝙩𝙪𝙛𝙛𝙚𝙙 𝙧𝙤𝙢𝙖𝙣 𝙨𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙖𝙘𝙘𝙞𝙖𝙩𝙖 was chewy but not too hard to bite with a prominent truffle aroma \n\nthe 𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙘𝙝𝙚𝙩𝙩𝙖, 𝙗𝙖𝙠𝙚𝙙 𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙠 𝙗𝙚𝙡𝙡𝙮 & 𝙬𝙞𝙡𝙙 𝙛𝙚𝙣𝙣𝙚𝙡 was delicious, the fennel with the meat was a beautiful pairing \n\nlastly, the 𝙥𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙤 𝙩𝙞𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙞𝙨𝙪, honestly was pretty disappointing, the flavours were so mild, i felt like i was just downing sweet mascarpone cheese \n\noverall standard is pretty good but i think this place just ain’t my cup of tea', 'man you’ve probably seen this cake for the billionth time now but man i come back to lavo just for this! \n\nalso was lucky enough to have met @nifuudo there for the first time hehe !! \n\nthere are many reviews out there saying how this cake is really dense and not mind blowing. i wouldn’t disagree at all but honestly, chocolate and peanut butter can never go wrong so just for the delicious thick, indulgent bite of that perfect combination and i get 20 layers worth? i give you my heart', 'mukjja! \n\nthis is definitely up there with the legit good 𝙟𝙟𝙖𝙟𝙖𝙣𝙜𝙢𝙮𝙚𝙤𝙣 s in singapore🤩 \n\nflavourful yet sinful. the noodles were cooked perfectly, having the satisfying slurp factor plus the chewy bite enveloped with the black bean sauce. the portion was huge at last for me and ingredients were substantial as well so for $11 this was really a steal. \n\nas for the 𝙩𝙖𝙣𝙜𝙨𝙪𝙮𝙪𝙠, this one stole the show, the sweet sauce and STILL crispy fried pork slices were freakin incredible \n\nthis is such an authentic korean chinese restaurant with really nice and wonderful staff, so if you are looking to escape to korea for a bit this is the place!', 'i was impressed at the first bite of these pancakes but breaking down the components, the main part was really not up to standard \n\nthe combination of japanese sweet potato, vanilla ice cream and pancakes were delicious. i really enjoyed the pancakes with the starchiness of the sweet potato and creamy ice cream. however when the ice cream and cream were running out and i got a solo taste of the pancakes, they were dense, floury, dry and lacking of flavour. probably the worst pancakes i ever paid for and at the price of $16 i wasn’t expecting this.\n\noverall it wasn’t a completely terrible dish but for something you are famous for you aren’t really doing it right honey', 'creamier has been around a while but this is my first try! got the pistachio cone and i forgot and can’t find the price of the cone but a single scoop is $3.90 which is already cheap in comparison to other ice cream places. this pistachio ice cream was pretty average to me, exactly what you’d expect with hints of the actual nut in it. can’t complain much but the cone was definitely on the sweeter side! personal favourite is still bop but this is still not too bad!', '🥐renowned for the best crossiants in sg and their insane queues, so question is, is it true and is it worth it? for me it’s a DEFINITE YES for both!!\n\nthe crossiant [$3] has the best texture, the outer layer, flaky and crispy with an airy interior and the honeycomb layers inside gave a fragrant browned butter aroma. it was truly divine and exactly what i was craving for. \n\nthe pain au chocolat [$3.50] was good but i think can be improved! the chocolate, i expected to have a higher cocoa content but it was closer to a milk chocolate thus making it sweeter, also i would rather the chocolate to be better distributed as the two strips of chocolate were one on top of the other in one spot. but honestly other than that, it is still a really good standard chocolate crossiant that you don’t need to skip over!\n\noverall no regrets at all! i went half an hour b4 opening on a friday to be the first in queue but soon after people started lining up behind so no matter what you are minimally spending 30 minutes waiting for these but should you do it? obviously, just go tmr hahahah', '🧇recc by @foodeatsmary \n\nbuttery waffles with crispy fried chicken i mean what’s not to love? honestly for the price it is really a steal for $9.50, the combination of waffles, chicken and maple syrup never disappoints me and this was no exception. the waffles were chewy and contracted well with the crunch the skin from well executed fried chicken. ahh i love it 💕', 'hi can i say i have found maybe the perfect cake? 😭 \n\nthis goma cake was enveloped with divine nuttiness and earthiness. the cake is a chiffon cake so it was really fluffy and light, the cream as well was light and airy. this made it so much less jelat and the crumble on top!! ahh the texture profile it adds, cuts the fluffiness perfectly to give a crunch, i wish there was a bit more tho!! but still if i gave ratings this is a 10/10 for me!! i’m absolutely in love💕', 'this is probably the best and most authentic eggs benedict i’ve ever had \n\nwith a toasted english muffin for the base, fatty strips of bacon, beautifully poached egg and nice tart hollandaise sauce as it should be!! it was really a perfect dish with the side of potatoes and sausage, really a full breakfast and so worth it 😍', '@bakesbymabs 😍 \n\ni’ve been eyeing bakesbymabs for months now and i am so happy i finally got to ordering some! \n\nthe 𝙢𝙖𝙘𝙖𝙧𝙤𝙣𝙨 were perfect. not too sweet and despite the cream seeming intimidating, the ratio was spot on and i just love all the flavours \n\nthe 𝙢𝙤𝙘𝙝𝙖 𝙗𝙖𝙗𝙠𝙖 was the first babka i’ve ever tried and i fell in love. the mocha swirl was so substantial and the sweet chocolaty flavour was cut nicely by the bitter coffee. it is seriously to die for😭\n\nthank you so much @bakesbymabs i loved everything 💕', 'second time at 8 degrees and it was genuinely as good as i remember! one of my fav things is their bubble tea with their chewy fragrant brown sugar pearls🤤\n\nluroufan an absolute staple in the taiwanese cuisine and tho this looks kinda diff but it is just as flavourful and mouthwatering 🤤\n\ntheir xo chee cheong fun is really something i’ve never tried before but man was it packed with flavour and with the silky chee cheong fun, it’s a cool mix up! \n\ncan’t really go wrong with taiwanese fried chicken so a staple in my orders \n\ni love coming back here but it’s so sad it’s so far from where i live😭', 'just thought this was a regular ban mian but man was it surprising yet month watering \n\nthis ban mian does not have the traditional dark sauce that you mix into, but a chilli paste that gave a delicious smoky flavour. i loved the spice level, it is not the kind that burns off your tongue but it hits the back of your throat and add a little ‘ma’. it’s the shiok kind of spicy and the numbing does not make you taste any less. \n\nthe combination of the the runny egg, the chilli paste, the minced pork and ikan bilis a delicious bowl i am now obsessed with', 'one of the many gelato places that opened up at sunset way! \n\ntried four different flavours and they were generally pretty good🤩 \n\nbut the waffle was truly phenomenal, crispy outside with a nice chew, overall the mouthfeel was divine.\n\nfound the oreo flavour pretty different cause it ain’t the regular common cookies and cream and it legit tasted like oreos! \n\nearl grey was fragrant but on the sweeter side for me. both black sesame and pistachio were nutty as they should be but i felt the black sesame paired with the waffle the best! \n\nmy only qualm with this was truly the maple syrup, it just upped the sweetness they towards the end, i could not continue \n\nbut overall really good stuff and generous portions so still a really nice little place with friendly staff!', 'sunday folk\n\nwas pretty excited to try this because just look at it?? but sadly i find that it isn’t really for me \n\nwe got the earl grey lavender waffle and this was just too sweet for me, the soft serve itself and it still came with almond brittle which just maxed out my sugar tolerance. \n\nwe also got the dark chocolate rocher didn’t have much of this one but this was less sweet than the first but definitely on the richer side too \n\nthe thing about the two that doesn’t make me want to come back is the fact that it is soft serve. soft serve is a lot more watery and thin compared to thick creamy ice cream or gelato. so paired with the waffle i didn’t really like that there was no contrast in textures but more liquid on waffles. it could just be me but i’m not gonna lie the waffles were superb. \n\na lot of people love this and so did my friends so i’m not saying it’s bad but just not for me!', 'i love this place oh so much 🍵 everything is delicious and it just has such zen calm vibes \n\ngenmaicha vegan gelato: ohmygod i’m not even kidding when i say this is probably one of the best gelatos i’ve ever had. genmaicha is a japanese brown rice green tea that is mixed with roasted popped brown rice. this gives the gelato a nutty aroma that goes really well with the green tea smell. the flavour was prominent with the addictive smooth creamy texture that i am in love with. \n\nok i’ve seen so many people rave about this goma cake but to me i found it pretty average. the sponge itself was dry and the icing as well. there was presence of the black sesame flavour but i was expecting a more moist cake. kinda disappointing if i’m honest \n\ndespite the goma cake not being up to par i still love hvala and you should definitely check it out if you are around one of their branches. even for non matcha lovers like me you can find things that you will like here! also i want to marry that ice cream', 'pizzakaya \n\nwas drawn to this place solely on the cool modern interior however the food really didn’t match up to the cool ambience. \n\nthe crust was chewier than i expected but most japanese breads are like that so it made sense. the failing point was the pork. it was really the failure here, it had a really strong frozen smell that made me unable to stomach a second slice. i truly was disappointed as it looked really good', 'glass roasters, another rare coffee spot in the west and prob one of the best coffees i’ve had.\n\nokay i do have to say i’ve not tried a load of it to say this is the best, but in my books, this is def up there.\n\nthe interior was also so well furnished and decorated that it felt really cozy and somewhere i would so come back for for a mid-afternoon coffee, my only real qualm is that it is pretty deep in surrounded by landed so, not the most convenient but nonetheless an amazing place that i am so happy i’ve tried', 'this place is obviously very well known here so there is no need for an intro but these are just my opinions on what i got!\n\n𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙣 𝙟𝙚𝙖𝙣, i chose this and was honestly pretty disappointed, the turkey sausage patty was overwhelming with flavour that did not allow any light to shine on the avocado or egg whites. so it just tasted like stuffing with on a bagel with added soft texture \n\n𝙝𝙖𝙣𝙜𝙤𝙫𝙚𝙧 𝙝𝙚𝙡𝙥𝙚𝙧 , this will be my pick next time! the combo of bacon, egg scramble and tater tots?! like it was just an indulgent, mouthwatering breakfast smashed into one.

Egg mayo croissant is my favorite as you get the bits from the hard boiled eggs and it blended well with the creamy mayo. On the hand, chicken mayo is a little too mushy for my liking. Overall, the croissants are really crispy, flaky and not too buttery. This is one of the best croissants I had in terms of quality and affordability. An existing promotion is ongoing - 𝑩𝒖𝒚 6 𝑭𝒓𝒆𝒆 2!

Even after I left it out for 2 hours, the croissants still tasted fresh. This is one of the best croissants I had in terms of quality and affordability.

It is first drizzled with sweet bean sauce, hot chili sauce and wrapped with ingredients like stir-fried turnips (also known as ‘bangkuang’ locally), shredded eggs, lettuce leaves and some finely chopped peanuts. The Popiah is thin yet able to hold on to all the ingredients, freshly wrapped when ordered and tasted crunchy with an extra punch from the chili sauce. I will totally recommend if it comes with those crispy bits, but this is still worth the try if you are nearby. \n\n📍 𝑀𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑎 𝐵𝑜𝑙𝑒ℎ, 𝐴𝑀𝐾 𝐻𝑢𝑏 𝐵2', '🍣 𝑰𝒕𝒂𝒄𝒉𝒐 | 𝑪𝒉𝒊𝒓𝒂𝒔𝒉𝒊 | 𝑰𝒐𝒏 𝑶𝒓𝒄𝒉𝒂𝒓𝒅 \n\n𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑟𝑎𝑠ℎ𝑖 𝑖𝑠 𝑎 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑐 𝑠𝑡𝑦𝑙𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑢𝑠ℎ𝑖 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ 𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠 𝑎𝑟𝑒 “𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑” 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑡𝑜𝑝 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑠ℎ𝑖 𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒, 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑦 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑟𝑎𝑤 𝑓𝑖𝑠ℎ. \n\n🍣 𝐁𝐚𝐫𝐚 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐢 - $𝟏𝟖.𝟓𝟎 \nRather than the usual slices of sashimi, Bara Chirashi are diced sashimi.

I like how the sushi platters are of high end quality ingredients but at the same time reasonably-priced (especially when it’s located at level 3 of Ion Orchard). Aside these, I love how it forms a lasting impression as all the staffs are welcoming and friendly - I must say the service is really good in terms of their high energy and service attitude. 👍🏻', 'Long holiday break and I enjoyed the high tea set at MONTI along side with Singapore’s most iconic view. 🎡\n\nThe high tea set is relatively affordable given the varieties of savories and sweets by the sea view, but in return the food is ‘so-so’ and hence slight disappointment.

however, we weren’t rly fans of the “berry berry good” bowl as it was a little sour, so if you’re like us u cld ask for an extra serving of honey to balance out the sourness of the berries:) do note that burpple offers a 1-1 deal so it’ll cost about $9.50 for a smoothie bowl and cup of homemade lemonade if u decide to use it!!

the cheddar cheese, despite being smth so simple, was rich and chewy, and added that extra texture that really elevated the dish. the dish also came with thousand island sauce and guacamole on the side which really complemented its spice, heat and intense flavour of the pulled pork. overall, a perfectly executed dish where all the components really blend together to create an amazing burst of flavours!\n.\n8/10 ⭐️\n.\n\n#sgfoodie #sgeats #foodblogger #sgfoodlover #singaporeeats #foodsg #foodphotography #sgigfood #sgfoodfinder #timeoutsg #sgfoodporn #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #sentosacove #mexicanfood #taquitos #pulledpork', 'can never go wrong w wingstop 🤠🤠🤠', 'omni kimchi fried rice ($16) & gardein fish and chips ($16) \n📍green common @ vivocity \nim not usually super fond of plant-based food but this place has definitely made me reconsider! the green common has a newly-opened branch in vivocity, and serves a wide variety of cuisines - chinese, indian, korean n western to name a few. eventually, we decided to try their kimchi fried rice and fish and chips. the kimchi fried rice came with plant-based egg, omni luncheon meat and kimchi. the kimchi was well-seasoned and full of flavour, and the taste came pretty close to that of authentic korean restaurants! the fish and chips were definitely my favourite - the fish fillets well-battered and seasoned, and the meat closely resembled the texture of authentic fish meat. on top of the two dishes, we decided to try the peanut butter banana oat milk smoothie ($8), which had a rich, decadent and creamy texture, with hints of slightly salted peanut butter - definitely a drink to try for the treat without the cheat! overall, while the food at green common may be on the pricier side, the restaurant is featured on burpple’s 1-1 deals, so be sure to give it a try!\n.\n7.510 ⭐️\n.\n.\n.\n\n#sgfoodie #sgeats #foodblogger #sgfoodlover #singaporeeats #foodsg #foodphotography #sgigfood #sgfoodfinder #timeoutsg #sgfoodporn #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #plantfood #vegan #vegetarian #plantbased #veganfood', 'gelatissimo (large cup, $8.90)\n📍gelatissimo @ shaw house \nalways passed by this stall at shaw house but never actually got ard to try it but i sure am glad i finally did!!!

one down side is that unclemario only offers the delivery option ($8 💸💸) which may be slightly pricey esp if you’re only ordering 1 tub on its own. nevertheless, the kapet is a hearty snack that is sure to leave you satisfied, and even if this isn’t kind of treat, @unclemariosg does offer a wide variety of other traditional snacks that i’m sure are of similar quality!\n.\n7/10 ⭐️ (would give it higher if not for the price 🙁)\n.\n.\n.\n\n#sgfoodie #sgeats #foodblogger #sgfoodlover #singaporeeats #foodsg #foodphotography #sgigfood #sgfoodfinder #timeoutsg #sgfoodporn #eatoutsg #hungrygowhere #snacks #peanut #kapet #homebasedsg', 'waffle + cookie monster & speculoos ice cream ($10)\n📍lickers @ telok blangah crescent \none of my all time ice cream and waffle faves 🙇\u200d♂️ the waffle and single scoop ice cream costs $7.50 but u can choose to add another scoop for an additional $2.50!!

I thoroughly enjoyed it when it was hot, when the cheese was nice and gooey. So be sure to dig in to the cheese first if you wanna enjoy the cheese pulls. Though I felt this was quite a basic dish, but yet I just love how this dish was plated. The only downside to this was the smoked salmon and toast.

Like VERY sour. As someone who takes sour things pretty well, this was really q overwhelming for me in the beginning 🤣 but the filling and cream was smoooooth. not too sweet nor cloying and refreshing 🤤 \n\n+++ THIS had hazelnut caramel at the base of the tart!!!!

The thyme crust was fragrant and went well with the rest of the cake 🥰\n\nHowever, I did find the cheesecake a little dry on the edges, which is probably normal since it is a baked cheesecake(?). Fret not, after you get past the sides and get into the cake, wowwww. The cheesecake is so smooth and creamy!!! It was so so delicious, felt like a paradise in my mouth tgt w the lemon whip.

Where do I start? \nI’m a HUGE fan of sour tarts so I had to get this. Previously I’ve had their medium sized lemon tarts which I absolutely enjoyed when they still had them for ordering on their website.\n\nThis tart was ABSOLUTELY gorgeous, the meringue was beautifully torched to perfection, topped with dried flowers and gold flakes. I dare say that this is the best BEST lemon meringue tart I’ve had thus far. I’ve been to lots of pastry shops to have their lemon tarts & nothing can be compared to this. Literally once you cupplets u never go back. After I had this tart, no lemon tarts could satisfy my cravings… 😭 These tarts are only available for ordering only when cupplets open for orders for certain dates, which are really exclusive.\n\nPro tip: Subscribe to their email newsletter and you’ll get notified for the dates that they’re having bakes. \n\nI collected this in the afternoon and only had it after dinner. I was so impressed by the crust; it was still hard and crumbly, no signs of softness. This was an issue I had faced with the tarts from other places, and wow!!!! Of course, the highlight would be the lemon lime curd. It was so smooth and light, not too sweet & refreshing. Ugh now that I describe it. I’m starting to crave for some😭😭🥰\n\n100% would recommend for all to order this🤍 I LOVE UUU @cupplets 💙', '🍩 \n🤍: 1x vanilla, 1x lemon curd, 2x blackforest donuts, 1x hojicha\n💸: $19 (3.80 each)\n💯: 🌸🌸🌸🌸/5\n📍Tampines Community Complex, @puffsandpeaks \n\nI’ve been wanting to try these donuts from puff n peaks for a really long time!!! I finally got my ass to the east to get these babies :-)\n\nI was surprised how good these were the next day when I took it out from the fridge! The donuts remain chewy and yummy, not too greasy yassssss. I’ve to say that they were extremely generous with the fillings- which I didn’t quite enjoy because it was too “jelak” for me! Of course this can be fixed by simply scrapping out the excess amount of fillings 😽 (多好过少🤪)\n\nTo my surprise, the hojicha flavoured one was my favourite!! I totally did not expect this cause I felt the lemon curd (I🧡sour) would’ve stolen the show 😆\n\nHowever, I was really disappointed w the vanilla flavoured one as I felt that vanilla would never go wrong HAHAH but I could barely get the fragrance of the vanilla ;( the filling was not sweet at all, which made me feel like I was eating plain cream \U0001f972\n\nNevertheless, I actually bought more donuts to give it another try, and I still really really love their donuts 🥰\n\nI would highly recommend the passion fruit, hojicha & chocolate flavour! ❤️\u200d🔥', '🍰\n\n🤍: tarts by shatec students ❤️\u200d🔥\n💸: $14.80 (what a steal!!!!!)\n💯: 🌸🌸🌸🌸.5/5\n📍: Shatec, Bukit Batok\n@shatec \n\nThis was a promotional (?) set I guess for pastries made by Shatec students!!

(But lesser calories taken in ya🥳)\n\nAnyway my fav fav fav was “Pisa Framboise”, I can’t really remember exactly how it tasted like, but I really really liked it.

My family and I wanted to see what was the difference between the alcoholic and non alcoholic (not shown since they look the same) one, hence we ordered both. Honestly I was quite happy to know that the tiramisu was so affordable :-)\n\nVerdict: As compared to the non alcoholic tiramisu, when I took my first taste, I said to my mum, “味道有点疯狂” (it tastes crazy) hahahaha (in a good way!). The kahlua was a tantalising delight, we were appalled by how well the alcohol and coffee complimented each other in the ladyfinger biscuit itself. The mascarpone was airy + light and not jelat! \nHonestly, I wouldn't be able to judge if this tiramisu is the best in town as this was actually my first few times eating a tiramisu 🤭 but it is something I would come back for! 10000/10 recommended for all to order this when you visit SYIP <3 definitely not to be missed 🤎❤️\u200d🔥\n\nPSA: swipe to the end for their menu!"", '🐮🍫🍼\n🤍: valrhona milk, 30% sugar, no ice\n💸: $4.80 (bought it with the Westgate 1-for-1 promo so E.A is $2.40)\n💯: 🌸🌸🌸🌸.5/5\n📍: Westgate, @milksha_sg \n\nI’ve always wanted to try this drink out, so I took the golden opportunity to try this drink out wth the promo 🥰 As a dark chocolate lover, valrhona always hits the spot for me <3 I love the fragrance of the valrhona, tastes like a premium chocolate milk from the supermarket. I honestly would’ve loved to pair this with their honey pearls but I just didn’t had the feels to do so that day.\n\nOO also wanted to say my nails are done by @cal_nailsplayhouse !!!

Personally, I’ve been avoiding creamer based milk tea cause it’s not good for health so I’ve been opting for fresh milk most of the time :-) definitely going back to try this with their fresh milk based drinks! ❤️', ""🍓🐮\n🤍: strawberry coulis green tea, 0% no toppings\n💸: $4.32 (U.P. $4.80) after using “BERRY8” promo code when ordering on @milksha_sg ‘s mobile app!\n💯: 🌸🌸🌸/5\n📍: Milksha, Westgate\n\nVerdict: \nThis tasted a lil like strawberry series of what another bbt shop has had. The drink had the strawberry puree jam thing aka coulis, at the bottom. I made a mistake for not shaking it thoroughly enough before I started drinking, so when I drank it, it was really sweet for me. After giving it a more thorough stir, the strawberry and green tea is more balanced.\n\nCan I also just say, that their green tea is really fragrant? The aroma of jasmine from the green tea was not overpowered by the sweet strawberry coulis, which I was really impressed by! \n\nHowever, I would say this wasn't a really special drink, just strawberry and green tea lor. Don’t get me wrong! I love the taste of it ☺️ But I would totally get it on a hot day to refresh myself :-). \n\nDefinitely going to try the other series in the next few weeks 🥰"", '🇻🇳🍲 \n\n🤍: pork ball pho \n💸: $7 nett\n💯: 🌸🌸🌸🌸.5/5\n📍: signs a taste of vietnam pho, orchard gateway (vvvv close to Somerset MRT)\n\nI discovered this store, “Signs a Taste of Vietnam Pho” from danielfooddiary! Ran by a deaf Vietnamese couple, Anthony and Angela. I’ve visited them quite a lot for their delicious Vietnamese Spring Rolls ($6), which has 2 sauces (chilli/peanut) on the side. \n\nBefore I get to the pho, I always look forward to seeing the owner of the shop (Anthony)🥰❤️. He is always welcoming and sweet each time I visit!!! I love his energy🥳 \n\nThis is my second time having their pho, and it is as good as I remembered it, the last time I had it. \nInitially, I ordered the pork ball pho. The owner actually recommended me to have the sliced pork one, which I decide to have after his recommendation. However, I got the pork ball one in the end as there was a lil miscommunication, which I was totally fine with!!! \n\nThe pho came with sauce, chilli padi and a wedge of green lemon.\nThere was a generous amount of bean sprouts and pork balls🤍🤍\nThe broth was light and fragrant😍 which I really love! As much as it was a tad bit salty to my liking, I could tell this did not contain any MSG! \n\nHighly recommend this delicious heartwarming bowl of pho❤️', '🍦🍳\n\n🤍: kazu kazu with hokkaido cream\n💯: 🌸🌸🌸🌸/5\n💸: $3.50\n📍: kazo (卡滋屋), jcube @kazosingapore \n\nKazo (卡滋屋) is a Taiwanese confectionery store! I’ve seen their outlets in quite a few places but it never crossed my mind to give their pastries a try.\nI took a closer look at what they had to offer when my friend was buying their hot-selling garlicky cheese bread🤤. FYI, the garlicky cheese bread only has limited quantities per day and they only sell it on certain days! \n\nBack to the kazu kazu, this is the stick version of a cream puff, where the filling is pumped into the pastry. \nAs I took my first bite, I was impressed by how fragrant and crispy it was! There was a generous amount of cream in it, which was not sickeningly sweet but rather perfect to my liking! (im not a sweet tooth ><) I could tell that the cream was chilled, which gave off a “fresh” taste to it 🥰.\n\nHowever, halfway through it was quite “jelat” for me ;( it could be just me as I can’t take dairy products well so try it for yourself!! \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this to all and I would totally try out their garlicky cheese bread soon😋', '🐟🍣🥢\n\n🤍: salmon sashimi (5pc)\n💸: $6.20 🥰😍\n📍: kuriya japanese supermarket, Great World City\n\nThis was fatty, soft, fresh, melt in mouth, comes with fresh wasabi (tasted sweet on its own😚). \n\nWhen it comes to sashimi, it’s all about its freshness and the wasabi paired with it. I could tell wasabi was freshly grated unlike the pre-packed ones!', '\U0001f9cb🍃🌱\n\n🤍: milk black, less ice, 0%, qq rainbow\n💸: $4 (add 0.90 for qq topping)\n📍: @yuanchasingapore, Far East Plaza\n\nTo keep it short, Yuan Cha has been my go-to ever since they opened their first outlet ever in Bukit Panjang. I was devastated when they closed their outlet at Bukit Panjang Plaza :( \n\nTheir drinks have a strong tea taste to it, including their milk teas. So if you’re more of a milky person for your milk tea, I suggest you give it a miss. I thoroughly enjoyed the tea taste in my drink and the qq rainbow topping is handmade if I’m not wrong!! I have no idea why but i always feel healthy drinking bbt from them HAHAHAH but ofc it’s not lah. 🤫\n\nGo give them support cause they’re a local bbt shop 🥳 they’re located at Far East Plaza and Jurong Point.', '🌟☕️\n\n🤍: caramel machiatto w soy milk (add $1) less sweet + extra caramel drizzle, cloud caramel machiatto (right)\n💯:🌸🌸🌸/5\n💸: $\n📍: starbucks, westgate \n\nnothing special, but I dare say this is a favourite among many 🥰 (among my friends at least HAHA). \n\nfirst drink on the left is the usual caramel macchiato. Sadly, even though I had requested for extra caramel drizzle, I felt like there was literally no difference LOL. But ok la horh less sugar into my body then yaHOOO. \n\nOn the right is the cloud caramel macchiato. The “cloud” part had a weird taste and it kinda gave me a headache as I was drinking it. The texture of the drink was definitely not something I expected it to be... would not recommend\U0001f972', '🍠💜🥛\n\n🤍: fresh taro milk, less ice with taro balls\n💸: $5.60 (+1.20 taro balls)= $6.80\n💯:🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸/5\n📍: milksha, 313 Somerset @milksha_sg \n\nMilksha is popular for its fresh milk series and the fresh taro milk is one of their best sellers! In March, they launched their taro balls topping, which is imported from Taiwan! \n\nI usually order tea with no milk/creamer but I had to give this a try because I’m a trash for taro 🥰.\n\nVerdict? On my first sip, I was astounded by the sweetness of the taro paste but subsequently I thought it was not too sweet after giving my drink a stir. The taro balls topping paired really well with the drink, it was love at first sip for me 🤣.\n\nAs someone who doesnt drink fresh milk that frequently (I’m slightly lactose intolerant and not a fan of milky taste also), I was surprised that I actually really love this drink! The milk + taro paste were well balanced teeeheeee. \n\nOverall, I would definitely get this drink again but not often because of its steep price... nonetheless, I highly highly recommend this to everyone!!! 💜💜💜💜', '🍕🥤\n\n🤍: slices n sticks pizza (pepperoni & cheese)\n💯:🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸/5\n💸: $9.99 (so so soooo worth!!!)🥰\n📍: little caesars, holland village\n\nI’ll keep it real short. So good, best pizza I’ve had in my opinion, affordable AF. try it. AMAZING.\n10/10 recommended', '🍔🍟\n\n🤍: cheeseburger ($15), regular five guys style fries ($9)\n💯:🌸🌸🌸/5\n💸: $24🥶\n📍: five guys, plaza singapura \n\nMy brother and I were taken aback by the prices of the food on the menu. The ala carte burger was $15, and the ala carte fries was $9.\n\nWhen we ordered the cheeseburger, we were told that we could choose what we would like to have in the burger (e.g. onions, lettuce, tomatoes, sauce). There was no limit to it, which I was quite surprised to find out.\n\nTaste wise, the beef was very juicy and tender and the cheese used was just nice and was overall very satisfying. It was a mess eating it though, as pieces of vegetables kept falling off but I guess that’s what makes it a great burger? \n\nNext up the fries 🍟! It was a generous portion of fries and i loved how the fries were done. It was pretty obvious that this weren’t the frozen ones, as I could tell that this was handmade. The inside of fries had the texture of mash potatoes, which were really nice. \nThe fries are deep-fried in peanut oil which I wasn’t really a big fan of. The fries had this peanut smell which felt rather jelat after eating a few pieces.\n\nOverall, I wouldn’t come back again for the burgers or fries but maybe I’ll be back for what they are known for- their milkshakes. \nIt is really pricey, so prepare your wallets if you visit Five Guys. \U0001f972', '🍜🇯🇵\n\n🤍: karaka-men (tamago)\n💯: 🌸🌸🌸🌸/5\n💸: $18.95 (b4 gst & svc charge)\n📍: ippudo ramen, westgate\n\nthere are 3 types you can opt for; \n\n🥢tamago (2 slices chashu, 1 whole tamago)\n🥢chashu (4 slices chashu)\n🥢special (2 slices chashu, half tamago, seaweed)!\n\nThey are priced differently but I really love that they allow customers to choose what they’d prefer to have their ramen with! (you get to choose the doneness of the noodles too🥳)\n\nI’ve to say this is one of the best ramen I had in Singapore. (Maybe I haven’t tried ENOUGH)\n\nAt other ramen places, I didn’t like that it was already salty when I take my first bite. When I had my first taste, it was not sickeningly salty! I enjoyed the rich tonkotsu broth and the noodles, which were perfectly cooked to my liking. \nAs always, I think the egg was the best part!! It was so soft yet cooked perfectly just like an onsen egg 🥚 \nHowever, the spicy miso that contained some chilli oil kinda overpowered the broth but I think they’ll be people that enjoy it😆\n\nTotally would go back when I feel like giving myself a treat! Highly recommended to all 🥳🥰🤍', '\U0001f9cb🍓\n\n🤍: jasmine green tea (m), strawberry pearls, 0%, less ice\n💯: idk how to rate this cause it’s just plain tea and pearls \n💸: $3.60\n📍: northpoint city @playmadeonezo \n\nI’ve to say no sugar green tea is my staple drink!! I’d drink it plain or just have it with a topping that I want to try from a bbt shop HAHAHA hashtag weight loss prog? Surprising this worked pretty well together!!

One of my fav pearls out of so many bbt shops actually 🥳 \n\nHowever, I must say that milksha’s price range is on the high side, I would rather get bbt from another shop in the area if I’m not craving for the pearls. \n\n🤍: refreshing orange gt + honey pearls (m), less ice, 0%\n💸: $5.20\n💯: 🌸🌸🌸/5\n🤔: the orange pulp(?) used in this were refreshing! however, it was strong only on the first sip and subsequently the drink only had a subtle taste of the orange.

Cherry tomatoes were not ""blistered"" as well hahaha but overall it was a very nourishing and protein packed meal - i enjoyed every bit of it still ❤️\n\nA little bummed the prices were raised since my last visit, but its okay i\'ll still patronise every once in awhile when I crave ""expensive caifan"" 🤪\n\nRating: 8/10', ""📍 Monday Coffee Bar (AMK)\n\nCame to explore this quaint little space serving up sandos and drinks!

The combination of gula melaka and durian is so satisfying, but recommend to share as it's a huge bowl and might get gelat. \n\nThe 𝐑𝐞𝐝 𝐑𝐮𝐛𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐨 [$𝟓.𝟖𝟎] is my personal pick as I love red rubies! I was so amazed at the rubies - legit HUGE and super crunchy! You can literally taste the chestnut unlike those from other dessert stores which are tiny 🤧 The sweetness level overally is actually mild so I think I can finish this alone 🤪\n\nTLDR, i would visit @jinhor.sg again as a paying customer!

Essentially, this tasted like laksa albeit less coconutty. The seafood gave some natural sweetness to the broth and thankfully it's not too salty.\n\nThe 𝐀𝐫𝐦𝐲 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐰 [$𝟏𝟔.𝟗𝟎] came with teokpokki, tofu, pork, maggie and assorted veggies. The stew was thick, and on the saltier side especially after boiling for some time. \n\nI actually enjoyed both pots due to the decent portions of ingredients given, but i'm not sure whether $20++ per pot is justifiable. However i must say it definitely hit the spot on a cold day ❤️☺️ Worth a try!\n\nRating: 7.5/10"", ""📍 @oatbedient \n\nAs a plant milk lover, I signed up for samples a few months ago and have finally gotten around to trying @oatbedient for breakfast recently! \n\nAt first glance, i love the hippie gen Z kind of packaging 🤪 really cute!!

Honestly, I won't be able to tell it's oat milk if you blindfolded me. I'm really excited to try the chocolate one as I have a feeling it'll taste like milo (which is always a good thing 🤪)\n\nWith its cute packaging and easy preparation (just add hot water!) @oatbedient makes a very fuss free breakfast option!

Insanely flavourful and bursting with mediterranean spices - this is one amazing meal and I would DEFINITELY go back again for more! If i were to nitpick, I'll prefer less sauce but I think it's really just personal opinion! \n\nIf you visit on Monday - Thurs 3pm to 5pm, you can purchase one pita and enjoy another at only $6!!!

Majority of the sweetness came from that top layer of icing and it\'s so unique from other banana breads out there!

SO DAMN GOOD 🤩\n\nI tried a bit of the 𝐎𝐦𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐞 [$𝟏𝟓] and it\'s honestly something you can probably recreate at home! Very simple and yummy ingredients put together on a plate so idt this can go wrong.\n\nThe 𝐈𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐚 𝐋𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞 [$𝟔] is decent, the bittersweet flavours are there but it\'s a bit diluted.

Those who are not a fan of Oatly and other brands because of how ""oaty"" it tastes will like this! My bf agreed that it really tasted like tau huay zui hahaha. Sweetness level was similar to a 25% BBT level - honestly perfect! \n\nI had the 𝐒𝐢𝐠𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐎𝐚𝐭𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐤 [$𝟑] the first time I visited, and it came with oatmeal grains.

It came with a singular char siew, black fungus and spring onions. \n\nOn first impressions it's pretty oily and the soup base is lighter in pork flavour which to some people may be a bad thing. I personally would want it to be more porky! The noodles were cooked al dente which gave a nice bite, and I enjoyed the egg 🤤 The char siew gave me a memorable impression despite the higher fat to meat ratio - think crispy roasted skin that is like sio bak. Would personally like it to be leaner as I don't enjoy fatty pork!\n\nTldr, I think for the price point i don't have much to complain about, but also I won't recommend to fly all the way to Beauty World for this! \n\nRating: 6/10"", ""📍 Nice Rice \n\nI'm not even a rice-loving person but this rice bowl from Nice Rice is gripping me in a chokehold. 😩\n\nHelmed by an ex one Michelin star chef, Nice Rice specialises in French-Japanese inspired rice bowls!

My favourite way of eating is actually by adding the dashi stock into the bowl of rice which really lightens everything up! ☺\n\nHighly recommend this place to satisfy your unagi cravings, and I'm looking to try the more expensive unagi specialty restaurant next to see what's the difference heh 👀\n\nRating: 7.9/10"", ""📍 Habitat Coffee\n\nA place with affordable NETT prices but also with hits and misses. \n\nThe 𝐒𝐭𝐮𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐝 𝐁𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐇𝐨𝐭𝐜𝐚𝐤𝐞 [$𝟏𝟕] is absolutely divine 😩 SO much textures going on and the pockets of blueberries and cream cheese (swipe to last slide for video!) along with the dense yet fluffy hotcakes makes everything so damn enjoyable!!! 🥺 The ricotta cheese on top adds so much value to the dish as well!

Apart from this I'll defo eat more of Poke Theory from now on !!\n\nRating: 8/10"", ""📍 Chef Choo's Signature\n\nHeard about this place serving quality western food through Food King and also after reading @kitchwen 's review💗 \n\nHelmed by an ex Grand Hyatt chef, I was super super excited to try the 𝐒𝐢𝐳𝐳𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐞𝐚𝐟𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐠𝐡𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐢 [$𝟕.𝟗𝟎].\nServed piping hot in an iron pan, this was surprisingly good 😳 It looked like it'll be a simple tomato based pasta with seafood ingredients but NOPE. The tomato took a backseat and the sweet seafood flavour shone through along with a herby note. The ingredients given were great as well, I enjoyed the scallop and mussel v much 🤩 Seriously a quality plate of pasta that left me super satisfied and happy! \n\nLike what @kitchwen said in her review, yes this hawker dish really very very ✨class✨\n\n#xuanfavs \n\nRating: 10/10"", ""Matcha mornings has recently been looking super pretty with this easy Strawberry Matcha Latte ❤️\n\nIngredients: \n- 3 strawberries, diced into small chunks and slightly mashed\n- 200ml milk of your choice (I used VitaSoy here) \n- 4 tbs warm water\n- 2 tsp matcha powder @naokimatcha \n- Ice\n\n1. Add the strawberries into the cup\n2. Dissolve the matcha in 4 tbs warm water and whisk till foamy \n3. Add the milk into your cup\n4. Layer the matcha mixture on top\n\nThe Superior Blend from Naoki Matcha checks off all the boxes - distinct umami with a hint of bitterness. As a hardcore matcha lover, I thoroughly enjoyed the earthy profile and the vibrant green 🥺❤️ A huge plus point for me is that it is really easy to dissolve as well!\n\nThe tartness of the strawberries surprisingly goes well with the bitterness of the matcha, giving the matcha latte a very refreshing twist. Feel free to add a dollop of honey to sweeten it up! A big thank you to @naokimatcha for sending this over - i'm a huge fan ❤️ \n\nNaoki Matcha is available on Shopee so get yours here 🥰 >> http://shor.by/shp_naokimatcha_sup"", ""📍 Glacier\n\nHardly any café which serves mains warrants a second visit especially within a month - but there's something about Glacier's food and aesthetics that keeps me coming back. 😍\n\nOozing at all sides, the 𝐒𝐦𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐝 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐦𝐨𝐧 𝐀𝐯𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐝𝐨 𝐓𝐨𝐚𝐬𝐭 [$𝟏𝟗] was quite nice! As all avocado toasts are, this cannot possibly go wrong and I like the smoked salmon which was slightly salty and yummy! The eggs were poached perfectly but the hollandaise sauce overpowered the avocado by a little. Overall it's a wholesome dish that definitely will fill you up 👍 I still like the French Toast better from Glacier so be sure to try that out!!\n\nRating: 7.5/10\n\nThis was no filter btw 🤪 100% natural beauty in a toast 🥰""]",0,,,
