Like, really happy. 3 months in, 2022 has been a great year for me so far.  Towards the end of 2021 I found myself a little directionless, feeling a little lonely, a little jaded from everything (school responsibilities, content, personal life, etc.). That all changed after that video at Chow’s crib.\n\nFrom then on, it’s been mostly an upwards trend in all aspects of my life. I’m starting to see the returns from things I started planning all the way in 2020, and put into action in 2021. A lot of it feels earned (of course, with a little luck as well), which makes me feel really chuffed.\n\nMore brands and clients are starting to come in, and more opportunities are starting to find their way towards me. I’ve deepened the relationships with the people around me, and my discord community has never been more active. I’ve also found some newfound motivation for plans in the future.\n\nI’m really grateful and I feel insanely blessed to be able to live the life that I’m living right now. Of course, I still have things that I still want to accomplish, and little worries here and there.\n\nBut I can categorically say that I haven’t been this happy before, and this excited in a long time for what’s to come in the future. And a lot of it has been due to the circle of people I’ve managed to get close to over the past  months. \n\nFor the ones that have been around me the past few months, and the ones that have always been around, thank you so much ❤️', 'LF>>>>>GF 4 lyfe #datingadvice #dating #relationships', 'Playlist can be found in the link in my bio :) #whatareyoulisteningto #addasong #streetinterview #spotify', 'At least you’re not a Liverpool fan atm #manutd', 'Playlist can be found in the link in my bio :) #whatareyoulisteningto #addasong #streetinterview #spotify', 'Playlist can be found in the link in my bio :) #whatareyoulisteningto #addasong #streetinterview #spotify', 'I filmed a different type of video this time round!

It’s easy to look at something not going your way, and then let your anxiety create these crazy implausible branching narratives to believe the certainty of something not going your way.\n\nThis is because of a tendency to interpret your experience in a way that coheres to your previous experiences, feelings and beliefs. In the midst of that, it would be easy to fill the plot holes with our own narratives just to make it seem like everything makes sense and is rational. It’s something I definitely used to succumb to, and some semblance of that pattern of activity still remains.\n\n‘The more you embrace being uncertain and not knowing, the more comfortable you will feel in knowing what you don’t know.’\n\nPerhaps the best thing to do in times of uncertainty would be to simply… hang loose 🤙🏻', 'Back in the Jurassic era, I used to only wear black and white. I am proud to announce that I actually wear colours now. I like this shirt colour. \n\nAlso a reminder to everyone, if you’re thinking too much, tell yourself: “It’s not that deep.” Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. That is all.\n\n@xingweird helped me take this pic', 'Year 3 for me in NUS was an extremely tough time. I was riddled with anxiety, stemming from a failing relationship, worrying about a lack of direction of what I wanted to do (aka quarter-life crisis), felt like an imposter in the course I was in, and academic burnout (Computer Science is tough).\n\nUp till that point I never really associated the idea of mental wellbeing with myself. Me, with mental health issues? No way. Only people that were clinically diagnosed could claim they had those issues. Well, that was what I thought.\n\nIntense worry about the uncertainty of my future, feeling a sense of overwhelm and lack of control in my life due to school, constant fatigue and having trouble concentrating. A feeling of dread when it came to nighttime as I struggled to sleep; my head clogged up with thoughts and worries that plagued me throughout the day. These are all symptoms of general anxiety disorder.\n\nYou see my fellow students, you aren’t as alone as you think you are. We are all one and the same in our feelings, even if our problems differ. You may think that the problem of you stressing to get an assignment done on time is inferior to that of someone else going through a heartbreak, thus invalidating your right to be anxious.\n\nBut it’s not a competition of who has the biggest problem, where only the ones facing the most have the right to seek help for their mental health. All of us have our own problems. The right to your own feelings lies within yourself. It would be great if we could collectively start to acknowledge our own mental wellbeing, to realise that it’s okay that we might have issues, and also to know that we aren’t alone.\n\nTo help with that, NUS is organising K(NO)W Stigma 2022, an event centred around breaking the stigmas around mental wellness. Join them in a panel discussion that would help demystify the topic of mental wellness, as well as create a safe space for more in-depth dialogue surrounding mental health.\n\nFor more details, head to the @nus.hwb Instagram or Facebook page, and you can sign-up for the event through the link in my bio.\n\n#NUSAreuOK #NUSKnowStigma2022', ""Goodbye Sheares Hall, the place I could call a home for the past academic year.\n\nA lesson I've learned about home: A dream home doesn't have to be a bungalow filled with swimming pools, bowling alleys, and more amenities than one could need. You don't need a penthouse, 10,000 square feet, or a balcony that stretches out far and wide. A home is a lot more than the superficial. It's a place of safety, security, comfort, and peace. A place you go to at the end of an exhausting day and immediately feel relaxed. A place without judgment, and where you can let your mind rest and be at ease. Even if that's a small little room at the corner of NUS.\n\nI'm not someone that has a large amount of attachment to Sheares Hall as compared to some of my other graduating schoolmates. I didn't join many events or CCAs, nor have I really made a lot of friends that would honestly persist past this graduation from the hall. But I would be lying if I said that 3 of the 4 years I've stayed here haven't impacted me in a large way.\n\nThere are a few things I would miss. The peaceful and quiet nature of Pasir Panjang. Communal living with the few close friends I've taken away. The subtle chirping of birds nestled on the roof (although I won't miss the bird poop), and the gentle breeze that flows through the corridor of the rooftop floor that I stayed on. The idea of having the beautiful campus of NUS like my own backyard. The low-rise buildings nestled around the area, giving me an unobstructed view of the sky in its entirety. As you can tell, this allowed me to experience some magnificent sunsets over the past 10 months.\n\nBut what I will miss the most would be having this space I could call mine, even if it was just for a short 10 months. A place I could feel safe in, a space where I could do anything I wanted. A small little room where I could feel at peace. At home. And if this is a teaser of what owning my own place feels like, consider me motivated in wanting to achieve that sooner rather than later.\n\nGoodbye Sheares. Thank you for the lessons learned, the people I've met, the tranquility you've given me, and the motivation you've sparked inside of me."", 'petition for power pose emoji', ""Senior's farewell night in Sheares Hall, time for another WADIO\n\n2nd pic is me in AY18/19 when I first entered Sheares Hall as a dumbass phantom freshman, telling my then blockhead Alex that perhaps I wouldn't stay past the first semester.\n\n3rd-7th pics are me in AY19/20 having the time of my life going for night cycling and block trip, saying that I'm not gonna stay past the 2nd year.\n\n8th and 9th pic is me in AY21/22 still coming back for year 4...\n\nFinal pic was the best sunset I ever saw in my 3 years here, and a reminder of what I'm gonna miss the most staying in hall: (ironically) Peace and general lack of noise pollution (because I stay on the rooftop floor and the Pasir Panjang area has low traffic and low rise buildings), good air and a dope unobstructed view, and having my own safe space to come back to everyday.\n\nThings I won't miss will be the CCA culture in halls because shit is wack although the system is necessary and the comm hall food which has less variety than pasta recipes I use.\n\nCheckout the vlog on YT as I dip out of Sheares Hall for good this time round lmao wadio"", 'Some of my photos are at an exhibition in UTown!\n\nSONDER is a photography exhibition by @keviision, showcasing photos from different photographers from the Halls of NUS.

Thanks Aaron for asking me to show up at your party.', 'I’ve always said that the world is a different place for the heartbroken. It moves on a different axis, at a different speed. Time skips backwards and forwards fleetingly. The heartbroken might go through thousands of micro-emotions a day trying to figure out how to get through it without picking up the phone to hear that old familiar voice. In the land of heartbreak, moments of strength, independence, and devil-may-care rebellion are intricately woven together with grief, paralyzing vulnerability and hopelessness. Imagining your future might always take you on a detour back to the past. And this is all to say, that the next album I’ll be releasing is my version of Red.\n \nMusically and lyrically, Red resembled a heartbroken person. It was all over the place, a fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end. Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild, and tortured by memories past. Like trying on pieces of a new life, I went into the studio and experimented with different sounds and collaborators. And I’m not sure if it was pouring my thoughts into this album, hearing thousands of your voices sing the lyrics back to me in passionate solidarity, or if it was simply time, but something was healed along the way.\n\nSometimes you need to talk it over (over and over and over) for it to ever really be... over. Like your friend who calls you in the middle of the night going on and on about their ex, I just couldn’t stop writing. This will be the first time you hear all 30 songs that were meant to go on Red.

You can contribute by writing content and threads that add value to ARC, being active on our socials and Discord, being an advocate for ARC’s community IRL and online.\n\nWhile minting Pyxis early will be one of the considerations, the 3 points above will play a bigger role in improving your odds (demonstrating value, referring like-minded individuals and contributing).\n\nIt’s time for us to represent ourselves and uplift the entire Asia NFT space.

Dylan had already achieved stratospheric acclaim from his treasure-producing workmanship and poetic abilities. He had already jacked up the bar of songwriting to an untouchable level. He also became a reluctant prophet, which can be quite an occupational hazard‚Ä¶Yet he remained himself while dodging all manner of con artists, bloodsuckers, angles, arrows, ignorance, injustices, and scrutinization of his life. His intentions remained pure. So he sat down and wrote the gold standard of protest songs, the seminal and most significant, mind boggling and staggeringly poetic, prophetic protest song the world will ever know: ‚ÄúThe Times They Are A-Changin‚Äô‚Äù. Dylan‚Äôs song applies to Covid-19, it also, very strongly applies to the life altering image of George Floyd, forever seared to our brains‚Ä¶ For me, it applies to the moment we are in, it applies to the moment they were in in 1963, it applies to everything before and everything since and everything that will be. \nI chose to perform this song live, for my friend @drbarbarasturm Covid benefit several weeks ago‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt really know how to play it, but I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot, as it seemed to apply so well. And it applies now, more than ever. It was performed a couple of weeks before our collective paralysis was rendered complete by the images of our fellow human George Floyd being cruelly and brutally tortured to death on live TV.\n\nLet us take a moment to remember the sacrificial hero George Floyd and look with hope towards the changes that his tragic death will cause. And let‚Äôs salute the reluctant prophet Bob Dylan and the dream of change he inspired then, now, and onwards‚Ä¶ His impact is that of Shakespeare, Marlowe, Hunter Thompson, Marlon Brando, Woody Guthrie, William Blake, Picasso, Bach and Mozart. \nDylan‚Äôs song is to be kept near you, AT ALL TIMES!!! All love and respect,\nJD', 'As the majority of American people, our global community and our extended family of humans helplessly watched a man die on television‚Ä¶ I too, was exposed to the atrocity of blatant barbarism, \xa0ruthless cruelty and unmitigated lack of humanity. \xa0A handcuffed man, pleading for his life lay prone with the full weight of a man sworn to defend the peace on his neck. The victim of this heinous act of cowardice, George Floyd, told the officers that he could not breathe. As he called for his dead mother, how could our collective hearts not break as his face was ground and mashed firmly into the pavement by those sworn to protect him, and all of us? Justice, I desperately hope, will address the horror of Officer Chauvin‚Äôs nonchalance and indifference to his participation in the agony, suffering and ultimately the murder of our fellow traveler George Floyd in a grotesque illustration of the abuse of power!!!\nThere is no way to make sense of what is senseless. There is no way to restore a life that has been taken. Just as there is no way to un-break a heart that is broken. \nWhat we can do is make a vow to ourselves that racism and the ignorance inherent in such judgmental ugliness that it gives birth to, is NO LONGER AN OPTION!!! THERE MUST BE A CHANGE!!! DEMAND IT!!!! My dear friend and brother, Killer Mike - (Run The Jewels), is a brilliant musician, artist, activist for social justice and the son of an Atlanta Policeman. He is also, one of the kindest, most caring and loving human beings that I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure and honor to know!!! I beg everyone to listen to the remarks of this true statesman.

Then suddenly the wind shifts and off we go on a new tack. And for far too long, these earlier interests or passions sadly fall by the wayside and recede into the vast recesses of some hoarder‚Äôs crawlspace in the brain cloaked in heaps of the other things that my skull had no room for‚Ä¶until recently. \nI found this painting, which I had started in 2006 ‚Ä¶ for 14 years I‚Äôd never touched the painting ‚Äì the occasional glance, at best. Yet it somehow always lingered in my mind, this piece of unfinished business. \nEven while we are forced to live in the immediate, some strange species of the interrupted passion that has been invested in an object we once focused on awaits our return from far away. I will keep you apprised of the progress! All Love,\nJD', 'and thank you for staying on this long road with me. JD', 'I‚Äôve been working on whilst being a responsible quarantinor, quarantining.

This was a huge blow to my family. My parents questioned: Why HH of all people? Why us? This is the case for most families whose kids are diagnosed with autism. \n\nGiven that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) was not well known 21 years ago as it is today, we worried about my brother‚Äôs development and ability to integrate into society. A society that wasn‚Äôt forgiving, or accepting to those who did not seem ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ( for a lack of a better word ). Everyday, we worried about how HH was going to go to school; make friends; get a job; talk to people; be self sufficient: and the list goes on. The worries were endless. How could we cope with having a family member with ASD, when we ourselves didn‚Äôt even know what ASD was? So, what is ASD?\n\nASD is a developmental disability that affects 1 in 150 children in üá∏üá¨, and it is generally seen as a different way of thinking. People with Autism often have problems with emotional, social and communication skills- which is why many people think of them as ‚Äúweird‚Äù, ‚Äúloner‚Äù, ‚Äúeccentric‚Äù. \n\nBut people with autism should not be defined solely by how they communicate, feel, or act. They just operate a little differently, and different is not necessarily bad. Different can be good. But not everyone thinks that way! And that begets the question: how can I be more accepting of someone who has autism? \n\nI don‚Äôt think there is a right answer to this. You can find a way to do so that suits you! It will definitely not be easy, but please remember to be respectful, and get over prejudice & bias that you may have. It is not everyday you may meet someone with autism, but when you do, be kind. \n\nIt has taken me & my family years, to learn how to cope and function with HH. The journey was difficult, and I do not think it will be easy for years to come. But I am grateful for everything HH has taught us- to be kind, patient, and loving.\n\n#worldautismawarenessday', 'my obsession with the sky! will! never! end!', 'bringing back an oldie but (a) goodie....\n\nshould I cut my hair?', 'me & plant ü™¥', 'all smiles for 2021üß°', 'hi!! it me', 'free drinks always welcomed? ‚Äòtwas a fun gals night out ü§ç', 'üñ§ü§ç\n/\nArt direction: Brian \nStyling: Vanessa @vnessalsy / Cassilda @cassildaalphonsine \nPhotography: Phoebe @phhoebeliew \nHair and Make up: Analisa @anegeilis \nLighting: Noah @noahchiam', '3am sometimes, light is found in the darkest of times', 'doge!!', 'love for batik & brunch knows no bounds~ üîÜ', 'a day late, and I am still thinking hard about yesterday‚Äôs dinnerüòçand yes also, happy 2nd anniversary ‚ù§Ô∏è', 'mid week blues made better with brunch and lotsa laughter!! and hopefully some mimosa next timeüíô', 'for the third member aka alex aka flora aka buttercup!!', 'üç¢', 'play, boy.', 'I can‚Äôt stop laughingü§°', None, 'not my glass ofüç∑', 'I have an unhealthy obsession with clouds', 'easy sundays with you ~', '5/5 power walkers / vegan wannabes\n#efficiency', 'these 2 months at home is giving me newfound confidence! confidence I longed to have? not sure why, but maybe it is the lack of social interactionü§òüèª', 'I like my new white wallü§òüèª', 'back at it with my photo trio', 'missing my last month tgt with these gals | we shouldn‚Äôt have had to part so soon(‚óû‚Ä∏‚óü)', None, 'just me, my windows, and the blue blue sky.', 'cooked my fav sesame oil chicken today!! go have fun with this recipeüò©', 'hey friends! just a video I wanted to share as I‚Äôm stuck at home!! but yes, it‚Äôs a modified version, and heads up, I‚Äôm not a cook whatsoever so don‚Äôt hate‚ù§Ô∏è', 'okay but in all seriousness, tbh it rlly sucks to not be able to hangout with your friends and extended family for your 21st!!

I constantly felt locked in a box but was holding onto the exact key that would set me free. This audio captured my exact thoughts these few days where I‚Äôm practicing to be more in touch with my feminine üíÖüèºenergy and to really find a balance between being hard on myself for the RIGHT reasons and rewarding myself for the steps I‚Äôve made to get there.

It turned out that I was pregnant and that it was an ectopic pregnancy, this occurs when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the main cavity of the uterus (in my case it was on my left Fallopian tube). An ectopic pregnancy is also fatal for the fetus as it cannot survive outside of the uterus.\n\nWhat this meant for me was that the pain I felt earlier in that day was all me - 5-6 weeks pregnant with a deceased fetus and with 700mls of blood flowing in my organs causing my internal bleeding from within. I was then rushed to surgery shortly after and was discharged 2 days later. \n\nI‚Äôve lived with this pain everyday since then and I‚Äôve went through a roller coaster of emotions, from pure denial that something this traumatic can ever happen to me, to dealing with the hospital debt after and trying to go back and forth to negotiate the instalments and lastly, to putting up a front to everyone I knew and hiding this truth for the longest time.\n\nI‚Äôve learned along the way that my toxic trait was thinking I could hold the world‚Äôs worries on my shoulders, and run. But all I was doing was trudging in mud that sank deeper each time. I‚Äôm done hiding behind my pain now, I‚Äôm still learning to let the people I‚Äôm closest to nearer to me but it‚Äôs still a work in progress. \n\n(CONT.
