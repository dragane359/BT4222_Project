# BT4222 Instagram Bot Detection

Our project aims to detect bots by comparing the contents of valid human accounts with bot accounts using machine learning, allowing advertisers to evaluate instagram influencers. The project looks into 2 aspects of instagram accounts: user-metrics and captions. Two datasets were used to develop models for each aspect. EDA and pre-processing of both the datasets were done to improve the quality of datasets before feeding them to machine learning models. Finally, machine learning models are used to train and fit the data to classify whether an account is a bot or human user.
